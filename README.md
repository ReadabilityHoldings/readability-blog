# The Readability Blog
A place for the Readability Team to share our experiences as we work to make the
web a more comfortable place to read.

## Setup
We're using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you have this cloned locally,
navigate to the root directory and run `jekyll serve`. In a browser visit
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the site.

## Building
When making changes to anything in the `/src` directory, you will need to build
the site to see the changes take effect. To do so run `jekyll build`. If you are
making a number of changes it's best to open a new terminal window and run build
with the watch option `jekyll build -w`.

## Comments
Comments are handled through [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). Admin account creds
are located in the Readability creds file.
