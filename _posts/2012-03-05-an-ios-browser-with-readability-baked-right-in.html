Readability's roots are in the browser. We started as a bookmarklet back in 2009; our <a href="http://www.readability.com/addons">browser add-ons</a> have been installed millions of times since then and remain one of the most popular aspects of our service.

But for all our success on Chrome and Firefox and IE, mobile and tablet browsers have remained tricky. You can install the Readability <a href="http://www.readability.com/bookmarklets">bookmarklets</a> on your iPhone or iPad, but it's cludgy, making browsing using Readability on iOS pretty rough...until now.

The newest version of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icab-mobile-web-browser/id308111628?mt=8">iCab Mobile</a>—a replacement web browser for iOS—brings the entire Readability feature set into your browsing experience.

You can read now, read later and access your Readability Reading List right inside the iCab browser. You can even sign up to Readability from within the app. It's a great way to deeply integrate Readability into your web browsing experience on iOS.

iCab Mobile is yet another great example of how Readability can help enrich apps and services anywhere. It works on both your iPhone and iPad and is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icab-mobile-web-browser/id308111628?mt=8">available on iTunes</a>. We highly recommend it.
