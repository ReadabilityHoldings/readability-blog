<a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ReadabilityActivity.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3480" title="ReadabilityActivity" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ReadabilityActivity.png" alt="" width="184" height="213" /></a>Readability 1.2.2 for iOS is <a title="iTunes App Store: Readability" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8">available now</a>. Along with minor bug fixes, it introduces new developer tools to easily invoke actions from third-party apps. Using one of the options below, you can launch the Readability app and prompt the user to add an article to their reading list.
<h5>Option 1: URL Scheme</h5>
Readability now includes the readability:// URL scheme, which can launch the app from a browser link or using the UIApplication:openURL: method. Use it without parameters to simply launch the app, or use the following format with a URL string to prompt the user to add an article to their reading list:
<code>
readability://add/{url}
</code>
<h5>Option 2: iOS 6 UIActivity</h5>
iOS 6 introduced the "share sheet"—a simple native interface to launch actions. We've created a custom UIActivity that you can integrate into your app. Simply import <a title="GitHub: Readability Activity" href="https://github.com/arc90/ReadabilityActivity">the ReadabilityActivity class and icons</a> to your project and wire it up:
<code>
// init Readability activity
ReadabilityActivity *rdb = [[ReadabilityActivity alloc] init];</code>

<code>
// set up activity item / action. url is a NSURL
NSArray *activityItems = @[ReadabilityActivityAdd, url];
</code>

<code>
// init share sheet with app-specific activity
UIActivityViewController *shareSheet = [[UIActivityViewController alloc] initWithActivityItems:activityItems applicationActivities:@[rdb]];
</code>

<code>
// present the view controller, animated.
[self presentViewController:shareSheet
animated:YES
completion:^{
}];
</code>

The ReadabilityActivity class also includes an easy way to check that Readability is installed on a device. This method returns YES if the user is running Readability 1.2.2 or newer:
<code>
[ReadabilityActivity canPerformActivity]
</code>
<h5>A more comfortable developer experience</h5>
The <a href="http://www.readability.com/developers/api">Readability API</a> has been integrated by thousands of developers into their projects. Now it's even easier to add Readability actions to your iOS app. Enjoy!
