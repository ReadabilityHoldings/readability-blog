<em>Today we continue an occasional series of guest commentaries by  Readability friends and neighbors. We believe the new Readability,  alongside efforts elsewhere aimed at innovating the reading experience,  is part of a broader conversation: the possibilities of fresh thinking  around digital content, publishing, and—especially—the future of  reading. They are some of the brightest folks we know: help us all take  the conversation further.</em>
<h2>The Path of All Things Advertised</h2>
As  advertising has moved from print to web, it has not followed a single  path. The classifieds have gone from the back pages of your local paper  to <a href="http://craigslist.com/">Craigslist</a>. The personals have migrated over to dating networks like <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/">Ok Cupid</a>.  Display ads remain, but in addition to publishers, they also serve  ecommerce and aggregation sites. Search ads have cropped up to fill the  spaces in between.

In  the mean time, the overall price of advertising has dropped, such that  current online advertising spending seems unlikely to ever reach the  heights of the print era: in large part because online readers are more  distracted than ever before—with ever more content from ever more  sources to consume—and so not as susceptible to the advertisers’ siren  call.
<h2>When Good Reading Goes Bad</h2>
At  the same time, the ads themselves, freed from the relative stasis of  ink on paper, have emerged into the world of pixels determined to take  advantage of their newfound freedom. They commit horrors their print  brethren could only dream of, leaping from the sidebar and dancing  across the text, flinging themselves between reader and words without  care for either, stalking us as we scroll down the page, taking over  backgrounds as if they were the very material on which the web is made.  The more we ignore them, the more brazen they become. This kind of  advertising so fully disrespects the writing beneath it that reading  becomes abhorrent: the kind of experience we should all avoid or get  done with quickly, rather than immerse ourselves into.

Likewise  the design of these pages has come to serve the needs of the  advertisers instead of the readers. The basic principles of good reading  design—whitespace, an appropriate measure, considered typography—are  not only absent, they are actively violated. We design pages for  clicks—for movement from place to place—neglecting the fact that reading  is an act of stillness. We intentionally  distract, polluting the visual space until it resembles less a library  than Times Square. And to add insult to injury, we cover up these ills  by saying people don’t read online—as if the design of a space played no  part in determining its use.
<h2>A Reader-Designed Reading Experience</h2>
And yet, people <em>do</em> read online. They read more than they ever did. They even read long  articles, and straight to the end. They read one article after the  other. They crave reading in the quiet moments of the day—waiting in  line for coffee, riding the bus, enjoying a glass of wine before their  date arrives at the bar. They read while walking down the street; they  read at their desk in between tasks; they buy devices that permit them  to carry more words than they ever could before—and with those devices  in hand they read more and more.

Along  the way, they’ve started to demand a better reading experience. One  that respects the basic tenets of good typography; one more portable and  designed especially for them—not for advertisers or search engines.  Instapaper’s immense popularity represents this corner of the reading  market: a small, but growing, number of readers who care so much about  the experience of reading they are willing to <em>pay to make it better</em>.

And that’s where Readability comes along.
<h2>Rethinking the Subscription Model</h2>
The  implicit premise in the new Readability is that readers are willing to  pay for what they read—that we see its intrinsic value. At the same  time, it offers a means of payment that is automatic—akin to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Click">Amazon’s 1-click</a>,  or buying music in iTunes, it removes the friction of payment by  centralizing it and obviating the need for us to whip out our credit  cards at every turn. And it does all this without erecting paywalls:  understanding that it is not the <em>payment</em> that makes paywalls so unattractive, but the <em>wall</em>.

When  you subscribe to one (or two) newspapers, and perhaps three or four  magazines, traditional payment mechanisms (create an account, provide a  billing address and credit card number, etc.) are perfectly fine. You do  them a few times a year and then that’s it; they renew automatically  (to publishers’ great benefit), and you hardly notice what you’re  paying. But on the web—where you might read a dozen newspapers a day, or  hundreds of blogs and magazines over the course of a month, that model  simply doesn’t scale.

Our  reading experience has become voracious and dispersed, and it needs new  payment mechanisms that serve this behavior rather than hinder it.

Readability’s  model—a centralized subscription that is automatically distributed  among the publications you read—is the first step towards this new  system. It is likely not the last; like any good product on the web, it  is an iteration from previous models, and it will continue to develop as  readers and publishers use it. Taken in combination with other efforts—<a href="http://decknetwork.net/">boutique advertising models</a> that serve demure ads in return for an influential audience, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/02/11/pixelmator">old-fashioned sponsorships</a> that resemble the radio interruptions of yore—it is a promising addition to an economy that values reading more than pageviews.

Moreover,  it is an opportunity for readers to vote—with their cash—for a better  reading experience on the web. Even readers who are skeptical that it  will raise enough money should participate, inasmuch as it publicly and  financially demonstrates your hope for the future: a web designed <em>for</em> reading, not a web where reading happens <em>despite</em> the design. No reader can argue with that.
