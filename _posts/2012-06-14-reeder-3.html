When it comes to the little touches, very few iOS apps come close to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8">Reeder</a>. It's one of the most polished and thoughtfully designed <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, Readability and now <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a> clients around. Today marks the release of a brand new, re-imagined experience of Reeder for iPhone and it's a beauty.

Reeder has included full Readability integration for over a year now and we're proud to be one of the flagship services of this new release. We could go on and on about all the little (and big!) touches that make this update stand out, but you really need to try it to appreciate it. Congratulations to Silvio Rizzi on what is undoubtedly one of the best news readers around.

If you haven't tried Reeder yet, now's a great time. It's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8">available on iTunes now</a>.
