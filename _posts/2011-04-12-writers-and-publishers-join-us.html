<div>Since Readability launched two months ago, over a thousand writers, bloggers and publishers have registered with us. We couldn’t be happier. By registering, you’re given access to your publisher console that shows metrics around which of your pages are being read by Readability subscribers. In addition, the registration process serves as the formal first step to collecting funds that have been earmarked by Readability for you.

If you haven’t registered your domain(s) with Readability yet, don’t worry. One of the unique things about Readability is that we’re already earmarking funds for domain owners prior to them formally registering with us. Note, however, that Readability only holds the funds for the last 12 months of activity prior to registering.

If you haven’t <a href="https://www.readability.com/publishers">registered with Readability</a>, please do so. It takes just a few minutes and it ensures that any funds derived from subscriber activity will go directly to you. We also encourage everyone to read over the <a href="https://www.readability.com/publishers/faq">Publisher FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://www.readability.com/publishers/terms">Publisher Terms of Service</a>. We’re always interested in your thoughts about Readability. Whether you’re a reader, a publisher or both, don’t hesitate to share your <a href="https://www.readability.com/contact">feedback</a> or <a href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com">ideas</a> with us.

Readability is off to a great start. We’d like to thank the readers, writers and publishers that have joined us in this first leg of the journey to help bring great reading and great writing to the web. We’ve got an incredibly exciting roadmap ahead of us and we couldn’t be happier to have you along.</div>
