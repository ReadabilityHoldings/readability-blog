Come this October, Brooklyn is the place to be. On top of the one-of-a-kind Brooklyn Beta conference, you can meet up with other like-minded folks and get tinkering at the <a href="http://brooklynalpha.org/2012/">Brooklyn Alpha build-a-thon</a>.

Hosted at the beautiful, funky <a title="Brooklyn Alpha: Location" href="http://brooklynalpha.org/2012/location">Cabinet art and event space</a> in Gowanus, Brooklyn Alpha is a friendly gathering of talented designers and developers focused on one thing: building something they’re passionate about.

We’re proud to be sponsoring this year’s event. In addition, our devs will be on hand to talk about Readability's best-in-class API and help folks get started hacking.

Brooklyn Alpha runs October 9th through the 11th, and <a href="http://brooklynalpha.org/2012/details">registration is open now</a>. Hope to see you there!
