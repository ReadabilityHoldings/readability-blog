One of the great byproducts of the trend towards quality long form reading on the web are all the great curators that have materialized. In most cases, it's just people that love reading and want to share what they find. For the rest of us, it's a welcome channel that stands tall above the swarm of links that fly at us in every direction. We owe the likes of <a href="http://www.longreads.com">Longreads</a>, <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a>, <a href="http://essayist.tumblr.com/">The Essayist</a> and others a big "thank you" for doing the hard work of finding stuff worth our time.

Today, we're excited to announce that one of our favorite sources of long form content, <a href="http://readability.longform.org">Longform.org</a> (at <a href="http://readability.longform.org">readability.longform.org</a>) has integrated support for Readability and our new <em>Send to Kindle</em> features.

But wait there's more! Longform.org's new sportswriting sister site, <a href="http://readability.sportsfeat.com">SportsFeat</a> also brings Readability and Kindle support. Now you've got no excuses for not filling up that Kindle with great reading before you head off for the beach (or lake or backyard) this summer. 

We've got more exciting partnerships to announce soon. Stay tuned on the Readability blog or <a href="http://twitter.com/readability">follow Readability on Twitter</a>.
