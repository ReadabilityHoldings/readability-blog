<a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Opera1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3327" title="Opera" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Opera1.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a>Readability is more than a website or an app. It's an entire platform. Since we've opened up our <a title="API Docs — Readability" href="http://www.readability.com/developers/api">API</a> and provided <a title="Free Developer Tools — Readability" href="http://www.readability.com/developers/tools">tools to developers</a>, you can add articles to your Reading List from a wide variety of sites, services, and <a title="Free Apps and Tools — Readability" href="http://www.readability.com/apps">apps</a>—not to mention from our extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Today we're adding one more to that list with the new Readability add-on for Opera. We're happy to be expanding Readability's reach to Opera's passionate, outspoken community.  Along the way, we're helping people use Readability the way they want to, with the tools they prefer.

You can download the new Opera Add-On <a title="Readability Add-On for Opera" href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/readability-2/?display=en">here</a>. Give it a whirl, and let us know what you think!
