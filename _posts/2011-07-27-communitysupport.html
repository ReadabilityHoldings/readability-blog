I joined Readability in June as <em>community support</em> liaison for subscribers, publishers, developers, and the countless folks who install the Readability add-ons. If you've tweeted, emailed, or posted an idea on our ideas site, then I know your name and we've probably already made contact.

For years, I've provided technological help to artists and writers, publishers and arts organizations. Working together, we built boats and robots, tumblrs and websites, networks and teams. Explaining computers and finding fixes for little problems fills me with joy and I love a challenge.

Readability should be effortlessly simple; it's my job to make sure you get great help when it's anything else. I'm here to hear you, to help figure things out, then to share your experience with the rest of the team so we can improve Readability for everyone.

Right now, the whole team's working on exciting new features and my big project is a support site with searchable questions and answers. As always, feel free to ask anything through the <a title="Contact Readability" href="http://www.readability.com/contact" target="_blank">contact form</a>Â and to share your suggestions on <a title="Readability Ideas" href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com" target="_blank">Readability Ideas</a>.

I look forward to hearing from you!
