<em><a title="The Morning News" href="http://www.themorningnews.org/">The Morning News</a></em> is an online magazine that's been publishing essays filled with wit and insight for over a decade. They're no strangers to creating and sharing great content on the web, and there's no shortage of high quality content in their archives just waiting to be discovered and read. In June, they started the <a title="TMN Weekender" href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archive/tag/tmnweekender">TMN Weekender</a>, a new feature powered by <a title="Readlists" href="http://www.readlists.com/">Readlists</a>, that helps their readers do just that.

Every Friday, they post the <a title="TMN Weekender" href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archive/tag/tmnweekender">TMN Weekender</a>, a readlist of great stories from their archives that complements the week's news. They take advantage of Readlists' great embed functionality, and drop it right into a post on their site. From there readers can click through to those stories, or export the entire readlist as an ebook they can send to their Kindle, iPad, iPhone, or other compatible device. That way they can take it with them, whereever they go—even if it's just the couch—and read comfortably.

Or if you'd like to peruse past TMN Weekenders, you can <a href="http://readlists.com/user/themorningnews/">browse their page on Readlists</a>.
