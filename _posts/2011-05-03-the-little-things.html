The team at Readability is bearing down on a major release update. Yet, as a member <a href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com/ideas/view/145/announce_small_features_and_updates_on_twitter_or_the_blog">reminded us</a> just the other day on our community site, <a href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com/">Readability Ideas</a>, it's the little things that count when you care about hand-crafting a better reading experience. Here's proof.
<div style="overflow: hidden; margin-top: -11px;">
<h2>Custom keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/themes/rdb/images/feature_chrome.png" alt="" />You <a href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com/ideas/view/13/customize_keyboard_shortcuts">spoke</a>, we answered. One of our biggest requests has been configurable "read now" and "read later" keys. Today it's <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi">available for Chrome</a>—coming elsewhere soon.

<h2>Progress dot with smooth scroll</h2>
<img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/themes/rdb/images/feature_dot.png" alt="" />Ever lose your place while scrolling screen-by-screen with your spacebar? The scrolling dot provides a subtle visual hint to indicate where you are in the text as the page scrolls. Look for it in your left margin.

<div style="overflow: hidden; margin-top: -11px;">
<h2>Summary and detailed views of your reading list</h2>
<img class="alignleft" src="/wp-content/themes/rdb/images/features_toggle.png" alt="" />A toggle to switch between a condensed and expanded view of your reading list? Streamlining the reading list view makes a lot of sense to us. <a href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com/ideas/view/12/condensed_list_view" target="_blank">Another member request</a> that is now live.

As part of our next release we'll be sharing release notes to document our enhancements. To Ilya, Marcelo, and everyone who weighed in with their vote to hear more about our updates: we appreciated the nudge!
