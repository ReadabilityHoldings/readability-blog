It's been awhile but we're finally here. Next week <a href="http://www.readability.com/ios">Readability for iOS</a> will debut on the iTunes App Store. It's a universal app that will work on both your iPhone and iPad. It's free and will be available March 1.

The primary motivation behind the app is simplicity. We didn't want to cake on features and above all else we didn't want to get in the way of the reading experience.

The app is the product of a collaboration between the Readability team and the talented and generally awesome folks at <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/">Teehan+Lax</a>. We hope you'll enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it.

<h5>Readability Everywhere</h5>

While we're incredibly excited to get the flagship apps out into the world, we're equally proud of the tremendous developer interest in Readability. You can see the fruits of that work to date on <a href="http://www.readability.com/apps">our Apps page</a>. We continue to be fully committed to empowering other apps and services with the Readability tool set. If you've got ideas or are itching to build atop or alongside Readability, by all means <a href="http://www.readability.com/contact">get in touch</a>.

We look forward to getting the app into your hands. If you'd like to be notified once the app is available, <a href="http://www.readability.com/ios">you can leave your email address here</a>.
