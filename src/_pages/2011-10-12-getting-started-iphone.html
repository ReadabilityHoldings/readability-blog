Congratulations! Your Readability account has been created. You're moments away from saving anything you find on the web to your iPhone for reading on your terms—anytime, anywhere.
<h2>Readability Everywhere</h2>
To get the most of Readability you can add it to all your devices and computers. Once installed, you'll be able to access or add to your reading list from anywhere. It's available for iPhone, iPad, Android, mobile Web, your favorite Web browser, Kindle, Twitter clients, RSS readers and more. 

Visit <a href="http://readability.com/addons">readability.com/addons</a> on your desktop (Mac or PC) web browser to install the Readability add-on. Once installed, simply click the <em>Read Later</em> icon and the page you're viewing will be automatically synced to your iPhone when you refresh your Reading List.

&nbsp;
<h2>Syncing Your Articles</h2>
When you launch the Readability app it will sync with the Readability service and download all of the articles you've saved for later. Once the articles are downloaded you can read them whenever you want, even offline. This can take some time depending on how many articles you have saved. You can see the progress in the loading bar at the top.

<h2>Your Reading List</h2>
The default view in Readability is the Reading List. This is where all the articles you’ve saved are stored. You can start reading right away by simply tapping on an article. You can view your Favorites and Archives Lists by tapping on the Reading List item in the menu bar.

&nbsp;
<h2>Manually Syncing Readability</h2>
You can manually sync your lists to make sure you have all your articles available by pulling down on your list.

<h2>Managing your articles</h2>
There are a number of ways to manage your articles in Readability. You can archive, favorite or delete an article from your list by swiping to the right to reveal your options.

You can also archive and delete multiple articles at once by tapping ‘edit’ in the menu bar. This will put you in 'edit' mode. From here, simply select the articles you want to archive or delete and choose the appropriate option at the bottom of the screen.

<h2>Customizing Readability</h2>
You can change the font style, text size and light/dark background through the style menu. <em>Note: While font and background color can be changed in the Settings Panel in the main menu bar, text size is only accessible from the reading view as shown below.</em>

<h2>Share what you’re reading</h2>
You can connect your Twitter and Facebook accounts to Readability and share what you’re reading. Tap the bottom right icon on an article view (you may need to tap the screen to bring up the menu) and you’ll see all the various ways to share. If you select the Twitter or Facebook icons you’ll be asked to login (you only need to do this once). From then on you’ll be able to Tweet or post to Facebook. Other actions include emailing a link to the article, copying a link to the article or opening in Safari.
