It allows you to browse your favorite subreddits on your iPhone or iPad with the polish and feel you've come to expect from top-tier iOS apps. We love it because the focus is on the content above all, with an emphasis on good, clear design.<img class="aligncenter" src="http://i.imgur.com/Sx6iR.png" alt="Screenshots of the normal web view and Readability view in Alien Blue" width="421" height="324" /></p>
