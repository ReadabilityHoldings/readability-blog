<a href="http://www.ifttt.com"><em>ifttt.com</em></a> is a brand new <em>thing</em> that connects the ins-and-outs of websites like Readability with triggers and timers, using the simple logic: <em>"if this then that."</em> 

Why are we so excited? Our <a href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com/"><em>Ideas</em> site</a> is chock full of requests for integration with Evernote, Twitter, Tumblr, and other sites you use to find and to share the stories you read.
