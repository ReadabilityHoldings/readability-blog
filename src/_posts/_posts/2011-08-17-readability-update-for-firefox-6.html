<p>We made a quick update to the Readability addon for Firefox to ensure compatibility with the newly released Firefox 6.</p>
<p>If you're using Firefox 6, jump over to <a href="http://readability.com/addons">http://readability.com/addons</a> and just click "Install."</p>

If you're upgrading from the earlier version of Readability in the Mozilla store, please <em>be sure</em> to <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Uninstalling%20add-ons">disable that extension</a> in the Add-ons Manager so only one Readability is active.)

<p>Do <a href="http://readability.com/contact">let us know through our contact form</a> if you have any questions.</p>
