When we first released Readability in the beginning of February, we never viewed it as a monolithic "app" but rather as a reading platform that just about anyone - publisher, writer or developer - is welcome to leverage. 

Today, we're really happy to see Readability powering one of the most elegant reading applications for the iPad: <a href="http://www.tweetmagapp.com/">TweetMag</a>.

<a href="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tweetnag3.png"><img src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tweetnag3.png" alt="" title="tweetnag" width="520" height="285" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464" /></a>

Built by the talented team of designers and engineers at <a href="http://teehanlax.com/">Teehan+Lax</a>, TweetMag is a wonderful example of how the reading convenience and flexibility of Readability can shine within a rich magazine-style experience on the iPad. With the new version of TweetMag, a subscriber to Readability, you can send any articles you come across right to your reading list. In addition, you can now enjoy your Readability saved articles <em>within</em> TweetMag. It's a great way to enjoy your Readability content on the iPad - online or offline.

More importantly, it illustrates the possibility of bringing a great reading experience - and a platform that supports writers and publishers - right into your app. The new TweetMag is available today on iTunes. If you own an iPad, what are you waiting for? <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetmag/id407131916?mt=8">Go get it</a>!
