When learning the ins and outs of something new, many people look online for help. When that something new is a piece of a software, the Internet can serve as the ultimate, ever-updating instruction manual and help file.

There’s a problem, though. All of the great articles about any given subject are spread over the entire web, on unrelated blogs and sites, disconnected from each other. Keeping track of them and using them as a reference can be quite cumbersome. That's where <a title="Readlists" href="http://readlists.com/">Readlists</a> comes in handy.
