From its earliest days, we've tried to find the very best talent for Readability. Above all else, we've sought minds that view Readability not only as an app but as a platform that touches many other apps and services, helping redefine the reading experience.

Today, we're incredibly excited to announce a new product lead for Readability. David Sleight will be joining the team to help define and drive the Readability roadmap.

<img class="alignleft" title="David Sleight" src="http://stuntbox.com/images/david-sleight.jpg" alt="David Sleight" width="150" />David’s been building products for the digital publishing space for well over a decade. He helped build some of the earliest web-based textbook experiments at Pearson Education, and went on to lead the Interactive Design team at <em>BusinessWeek</em> from 2005 to 2010. More recently he’s been advising content companies and startups on design, user experience, and front-end development through his own consultancy, Stuntbox, LLC. He’s also a <a title="David Sleight (@stuntbox) on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/stuntbox">muppet on Twitter</a> and an <a title="Stuntbox" href="http://stuntbox.com">occasional blogger</a>.

As many of you know, Readability is more than just a product. It represents a larger vision about how reading and web content is evolving. We couldn't be more excited to have David at the helm to not only help realize that vision but to help define it as well.

Please join us in welcoming him.
