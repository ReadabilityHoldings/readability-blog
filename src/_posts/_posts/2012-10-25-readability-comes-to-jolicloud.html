For those that don’t know, Jolicloud lets you view and use all your cloud-based services like Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, and more inside a single, well-designed web app. We’re big fans of the polish and thought the Jolicloud team have put into their product, and are excited to be part of their story. It’s just another example of the great third-party apps, sites, and services that are being built using Readability’s best-in-class API and tools.
