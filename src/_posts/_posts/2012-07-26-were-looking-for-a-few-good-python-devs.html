Are you a crack Python dev? A self-starter with a broad range of talents? Are you interested in shaping the future of content, and having a little fun along the way, too? <a href="mailto:jobs@readability.com">Drop us an email with your résumé and a few code samples</a>, and let’s get talking!

Applicants should…
<ul>
	<li>Be based in the New York City area.</li>
	<li>Be ready for a challenging Python gig, heavy on the Django.</li>
	<li>Be comfortable working at scale.</li>
	<li>Be a reader. (We <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">eat our own dog food</a> at Readability, and you should too!)</li>
</ul>
That’s the high level stuff. We’ll spare you the run-on list of gory details (we know you’re busy, too). <a href="mailto:jobs@readability.com">Get in touch,</a> and let’s build something together!
