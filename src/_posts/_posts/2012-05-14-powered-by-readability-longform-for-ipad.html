This past week marked an important milestone for Readability: <a href="http://www.longformapp.com/">Longform for iPad</a> made its debut. Built by the team behind the popular <a href="http://longform.org/">Longform.org</a>, the Longform reader is a home for the best in-depth writing from across the web. Notably for us, it is the first app independently created from the ground up using the Readability platform. 

It's not just integrating Readability—it's built <em>atop </em>Readability.›

Last year, the Longform guys gave us an idea of what they were planning for their iPad app and asked if it would be possible to allow for saving articles from the app into Readability reading lists. We said sure—and that we could also serve the articles featured in the app directly from the Readability API. This saved Longform significant development time and helped create another place to show off Readability's incredible parser.

Today, within Longform you can log in to your Readability account, save articles you find for reading later and read in either the web view or the more comfortable reading view. It's a great experience, and we're looking forward to working with the Longform guys to make it even better.

From the day we launched nearly a year ago, we envisioned Readability not only as an "app" that readers can enjoy but a platform that fuels innovation in a shifting world of digital reading. When we say "platform," we mean it in a literal sense: we're thrilled with the idea of providing a foundation, a platform, for others to build upon. Rather than strictly funneling people to Readability apps, our goal is to provide powerful tools and capabilities that allow anyone to enrich the reading experience anywhere.

Longform for iPad is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/longform/id490437064">available on iTunes</a> today. Obvious biases aside, we highly recommend it.
