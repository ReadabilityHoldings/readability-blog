Even though the latest version of Readability has been tested with Firefox 7 and 8, an incompatibility error has appeared for many users after Firefox does an automatic update. It should be as simple as re-installing from our add-ons page: <a href="http://readability.com/addons" title="Readability Add-ons">http://readability.com/addons </a>

We're working on a more permanent solution to prevent this from happening in all future versions of Firefox. <a href="http://readability.com/contact" title="Contact Readability">Let us know</a> if you have any questions.
