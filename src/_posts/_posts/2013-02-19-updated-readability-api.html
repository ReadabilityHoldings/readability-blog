Since day one of Readability's launch as a service we've made the entire platform's feature set available through the Readability API. The results ever since have been amazing. From full-featured clients like <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> and <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a> to <em>send-to</em> integration in <a href="http://readability.com/apps">tons of apps</a>, Readability has truly evolved beyond our own apps into a full-fledged reading platform. 

Today, we're excited to unveil an updated simple one-click step for developers and partners to get rolling with any one of our three APIs: the basic feature set, the content parser or the rdd.me URL shortener (note the rdd.me API requires no key).  When you visit the <a href="http://readability.com/developers/api">Readability APIs home page</a>, you'll be greeted with the proverbial first step: get your API keys!

After registering (or logging in if you're an existing user) you'll be handed your own unique API keys to get started.

If you're an existing Readability user, just visit your <em>My Account</em> page and navigate to the <em>API</em> tab. From there, you're asked to fill out a brief form and voil√†:

To date, we've granted over 2,000 keys and watched an amazing ecosystem develop around Readability. Now that we've made it so much easier for developers to get started, we can't wait to see what you come up with next.
