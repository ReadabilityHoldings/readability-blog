Earlier today Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/41/meet-the-dropbox-saver">announced</a> a new and easy way for apps to save files to your Dropbox. We thought that sounded pretty great, so starting <b>right now</b> you can save any Readlist to your Dropbox with just a couple clicks.

Save to Dropbox is located in the export section of every Readlist. All you'll need is a Dropbox account and a desire to collect some wonderfully curated content. If you're looking for excellent Readlists, check out the <a href="http://readlists.com/">featured ones</a> on the home page.
