Ever since we let loose <a href="http://www.readlists.com">Readlists</a>, we've been consistently impressed with the compilations that people have put together. From <a href="http://readlists.com/989ab34a/">coffee guides</a> to the <a href="http://readlists.com/8f505f64/">user experience of science fiction</a> to <a href="http://readlists.com/66d848da/">nondual awareness</a>, just about every topic from mainstream and topical to the niche-iest of niche exists.

<a href="http://readlists.com"><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" title="Readlists" src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2206822893/twitteravatar.png" alt="Readlists" width="80" height="80" /></a>

Recently, we stumbled on a very special readlist that we just had to share: the <a href="http://readlists.com/919501ec/">Digital Collection of Gezi Park Articles</a>. It is a<em> </em>massive (and we mean massive) collection of reads on the protests and political unrest in Turkey. It's so large in fact that the curator hit the 150 article limit, which naturally led to <a href="http://readlists.com/82b241bd/">Part 2</a>.

So if you're interested in Turkish politics, cancel your weekend plans and hole up. You've got a lot of reading ahead. Everyone else, there's an endless world of readlists to discover. And if you don't find any that fit your liking, you can always roll your own.

Happy reading...and curating!
