We're pleased as punch today to release a new web mobile experience for all Readability subscribers. It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up to be faster and more efficient on iOS and Android phones and tablets—hello, <em>Nook Color</em>!

<img src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rdb_mobile.png" alt="Readability Mobile" title="Readability Mobile" width="433" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1379" />

Powered by cleaner code and new javascript libraries (including Zepto, Underscore, Backbone, iScroll, and Persistence), the new version is a third smaller and makes half as many requests.

How can you get it? If you're a <a href="https://www.readability.com/readers/register">subscriber</a>, you're already got the new version. Just visit <a href="http://readability.com">http://readability.com</a> on your mobile device (or open the Home Screen app again if you made one)—voila!

There may be one or two things missing—<em>swipe gestures for instance</em>—but we'll add them back in. For today, we wanted to do good things for the speed and usefulness of all mobile users rather than wait for all the features we dream of. 

Please make suggestions on our <a href="http://readability.bonfireapp.com"><em>Ideas</em> site</a> or send feedback straight to <a href="http://www.readability.com/contact">contact@readability.com</a>
