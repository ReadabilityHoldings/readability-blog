Today we're happy to announce that we've partnered up with the team at <a href="http://www.skyfire.com/">Skyfire</a> to add Readability support to Horizon, their new <a href="http://www.skyfire.com/en/for-operators/skyfire-horizon">mobile browser extension platform</a>. Working with wireless carriers and OEMs, Skyfire's add-ons for Android and iPhone have been downloaded over 15 million times. We're excited to be bringing the Readability platform to this diverse and vibrant audience.
