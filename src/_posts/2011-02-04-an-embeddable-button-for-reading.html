Before Readability came around, the minute I decided I wanted to settle into reading a page on the web, I would fish around for the <em>Print</em> button. It wasn't an ideal solution, but it did present a slightly better reading view than the original page. It still usually required some additional messing around to increase the text size and such. It was far from ideal.

Readability, of course, changed all that. Still, the tool has always been a reader add-on - until now. With the <a href="http://www.readability.com">new Readability</a>, we've introduced an <a href="http://www.readability.com/publishers/tools/">embeddable button</a> that can be added to any web article Â or blog post. When a visitor is viewing one of your pages, with just one click they'll get a clean, comfortable and customizable reading view:

<a href="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/embed-tool.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170" title="embed-tool" src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/embed-tool.png" alt="" width="216" height="175" /></a>

It's incredibly simple to install. Just drop the code snippet in the appropriate place in your blog or CMS templates and you're good to go. It's available for anyone to use, no sign-up or registration required.

If you've dropped the Readability button on your web site or blog, be sure to <a href="http://twitter.com/readability">let us know</a>. We always enjoy seeing that little red couch <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2011/02/reading-is-fundamental.html">in the wild</a>.
