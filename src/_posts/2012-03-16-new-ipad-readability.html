It's been an insane few weeks here at Readability HQ between the release of <a href="http://readability.com/ios">Readability for iOS</a> on March 1 and release of <a href="http://readability.com/android">Readability for Android</a> on Monday. The avalanche of activity that came our way made us feel a little like <a href="http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/1300000/The-Ball-and-Indie-indiana-jones-1379826-485-330.jpg">this guy</a>. But don't get us wrong, the wild ride has been welcome.

From the start, we wanted the apps to be drop-dead gorgeous. And today we're proud to announce that right on time for the new iPads, Readability has been updated and is available in the App Store in hi-res, retina-display-ready glory. If you're on the fence about grabbing a new iPad, firing up Readability with its gorgeous typography and elegant interactions on the new iPad may well push you over the edge. We hate to say this in a blog post, but you really have to see it live.

Of course, Readability still works inside of a <a href="http://www.readability.com/apps">host of apps</a>, including an amazing integration with the newly updated hi-res version of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id375661689?mt=8">Reeder app</a>. And Readability renders perfectly well on all the previous generations of iPhones and iPads as well. If you already have the Readability app, don't forget to upgrade. If you don't, well you definitely don't have an excuse now. It's free and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8">ready to go on the App Store</a>.
