The <em><a title="Columbia Journalism Review" href="http://cjr.org/">Columbia Journalism Review</a></em> covers journalism, the media, and the stories behind the news with great skill and experience. For their <a title="Swing States Project : CJR" href="http://www.cjr.org/swing_states_project/">Swing States Project</a>, they hired reporters to monitor local political coverage in battleground states during the 2012 US elections. With the election finally over, they've packaged up the best of the <a title="Darts &amp; Laurels : CJR" href="http://www.cjr.org/darts_and_laurels/">Darts &amp; Laurels</a> coverage that resulted into a <a title="Covering Election 2012: Darts &amp; Laurels" href="http://readlists.com/416732ae/">handy readlist</a>.

On their quest to help local press counteract misinformation and the impact of dark money in the election, <em>CJR</em>'s reporters read and analysed a lot of articles, running the gamut from lackluster to laudable. The articles on either side of the spectrum were singled out as darts and laurels, respectively.

"Taken individually, each dart or laurel clarifies a critical issue that appeared on the campaign trail, and reviews one or two efforts to cover it. But together, they provide a more comprehensive look at the performance of the campaign press through the elections," said <em>CJR's</em> Communications Manager, Brendan Fitzgerald, when we caught up with him earlier this week. Compiling them together into a <a title="Covering Election 2012: Darts &amp; Laurels" href="http://readlists.com/416732ae/">readlist</a> created a free, downloadable anthology readers can export directly to their favorite reading devices.
