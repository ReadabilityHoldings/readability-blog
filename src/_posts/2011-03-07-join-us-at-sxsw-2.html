If you're attending SXSW Interactive this year, Readability and <a href="http://www.arc90.com">Arc90</a> will have a small contingency roaming the streets of Austin. We've created an <a href="http://twitter.com/arc90/sxsw">@arc90/SXSW</a> on Twitter to make it easier to reach us. 

As for the conference itself, we're involved in a few of the talks:
<ul>
	<li>On Saturday at 11am, I'll be joining a panel on <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP000327">rewarding creators and crowdfunding</a>.</li>
	<li>On Sunday at 12:30pm, we plan on crashing a <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP8098">The Death of the Death of Longform Journalism</a>. Evan Ratliff of <a href="http://atavist.net/">The Atavist</a> and Max Linsky of <a href="http://www.longform.org">Longform.org</a> will talk about the comeback of longform writing on the web.</li>
	<li>And last but not least, at 3:30pm on Sunday we'll be debuting the next Arc90 Lab experiment: <a href="http://www.donahueapp.com">Donahue</a>. The talk, entitled <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP6389">Toss the Projector: Redefining the Presenter/Audience Dynamic</a> explores new and innovative ways for audience and presenter to interact. Built in partnership with <a href="http://www.behaviordesign.com">Behavior Design</a>, and presented by Behavior's Chris Fahey and Arc90's Tim Meaney, we hope it will be a unique and provocative experience.</li>
</ul>
Beyond all the panels and presentations, we'd love to meet you if you're attending. On Sunday night, we plan on posting a meeting place on Twitter for a drink (or two). Be sure to <a href="http://twitter.com/readability">follow us on Twitter</a> for updates.

See you there!
