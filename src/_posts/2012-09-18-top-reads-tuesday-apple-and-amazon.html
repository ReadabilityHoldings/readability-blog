The last two weeks on Top Reads have been all about Amazon and Apple. After both companies held their big media events, <a title="Top Reads on Readability" href="http://readability.com/top-reads/">Top Reads</a>, our constantly updated list of the most popular articles from across the entire Readability platform, lit up with news and commentary. Some highlights from the last two weeks of the Web's most-read content:
<ul>
	<li>The Verge <a title="The Verge Review of the Amazon Kindle Fire HD" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/11/3317586/kindle-fire-hd-review-7-inch">reviews the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD</a>, and they seem to think it's OK</li>
	<li>Daring Fireball takes a break from Apple, setting its sights on <a title="Amazon's Play on Daring Fireball" href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/09/amazons_play">Amazon's big media event</a></li>
	<li>Fast Company's Co.DESIGN takes a look at <a title="Will Apple’s Tacky Software-Design Philosophy Cause A Revolt? on Co.DESIGN" href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt">Apple's skeumorphism obsession</a>, and whether it's causing internal strife at the company</li>
	<li>John Battelle asks "<a title="Am I An Outlier, or Are Apple Products No Longer Easy to Use?" href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2012/09/am-i-an-outlier-or-are-apple-products-no-longer-easy-to-use.php">Am I An Outlier, or Are Apple Products No Longer Easy to Use?</a>"—and with a headline like that, we're not surprised it wound up on Top Reads</li>
	<li>And John Gruber returns to his wheelhouse with <a title="iPhone 5 Event on Daring Fireball" href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/09/iphone_5_event">a rundown of Apple's iPhone 5 media event</a></li>
