As part of wrapping up our Publisher Payment program a short while ago, we <a title="Readability Blog: An Important Announcement" href="http://blog.readability.com/2012/06/announcement/">donated the lion’s share</a> of its unclaimed funds to two fantastic non-profits that support reading and writing. Our goal with these donations is to promote groups that foster the creation of high quality content, build the tools that make it possible, and cultivate the audience needed to support it.

That wrap-up continues today with the first of three final donations, starting things off with a $10,000 contribution to <a href="http://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a>.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning, non-profit newsroom that produces, "journalism in the public interest.” Motivated by a desire to support the kind of investigative journalism most at risk from today's shrinking news budgets, ProPublica has grown into one of the brightest points on the journalism landscape. Their operations now support a newsroom of 34 working journalists, and their work has garnered <a href="http://www.propublica.org/awards/">numerous awards</a>.

We spoke with Richard Tofel, ProPublica's General Manager, earlier this week. For him, "ProPublica is an organization that publishes investigative journalism stories that spark change. Often, these are in long form. That makes us big fans of services like Readability, which help make valuable content more accessible. We’re also dependent on our donors, and are very grateful for Readability’s support.”

We're proud to be lending our support, both in the form of  this donation, and by continuing to grow the <a title="Readability" href="http://readability.com/">most powerful reading platform on the Web</a>. It's our mission to elevate great content like ProPublica's by helping make it more accessible, portable, and useful for readers.
