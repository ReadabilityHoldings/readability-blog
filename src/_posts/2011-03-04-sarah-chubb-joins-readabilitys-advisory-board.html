Over the past 20 years, Sarah successfully spearheaded all of Condé Nast's technology initiatives across its various properties - bringing some of the biggest brands in publishing to the web. A few weeks ago, Sarah announced she was leaving Condé Nast.

We couldn't be happier to have Sarah's industry experience and knack for peering ahead on our side. She will be joining our incredible group of advisors: <a class="main-link" href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>, <a class="main-link" href="http://rogerblack.com/">Roger Black</a>, Jay Chakrapani, <a class="main-link" href="http://dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash</a>, <a class="main-link" href="http://www.ftrain.com/">Paul Ford</a>, <a class="main-link" href="http://predicate-llc.com">Jeffrey MacIntyre</a>, <a class="main-link" href="http://karenmcgrane.com/">Karen McGrane</a> and <a class="main-link" href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>.
