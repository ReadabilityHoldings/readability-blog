Just a quick update to let all of our developer friends know that we've rolled full tagging support into the Readability API, including support for tag creation via your third-party apps.Â It's already live, and you can check out all the details <a title="Readability API docs" href="http://www.readability.com/developers/api">over in our API docs</a>. Better yet, sign up for a free Readability account and <a title="Readability: Request API key" href="http://www.readability.com/account/connections/#request-api-key">grab an API key</a> for instant access.

Readability has grown into a reading platform in the truest sense. Beyond our our own site and apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readability">Android</a>, the lion's share of our traffic comes from great third-party apps like <a href="https://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a>, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>, <a href="http://www.longformapp.com/">Longform</a>, and <a href="http://www.readability.com/apps">many, many others</a>. Continuing to grow one of the best reading APIs on the market is at the heart of what we do, and we can't wait to see what you'll build with it.
