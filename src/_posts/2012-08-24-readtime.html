Here at Readability, we love to see innovative uses of our platform and <a href="http://www.readability.com/developers/api">API</a>. With that in mind, we’re pleased to tell you about a new third party iPhone app called <a title="Readtime - Get things read" href="http://www.readtimeapp.com/">Readtime</a>.

<a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/readtime.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2951" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/readtime.jpeg" alt="Readtime's dial" width="334" height="480" /></a>

When your Reading List has piled up, and you have a minute—or 5, or 10—but don't know what to read, Readtime is the app for you.

Simply dial in the amount of time you want to spend reading, and it fetches the right amount of articles from your Reading List. Then you can enjoy reading the right article at the right time, in a clutter-free, intuitive interface.

Readtime is available for $1.99 on <a title="Readtime, on the iTunes App Store" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readtime/id549039409?mt=8">the iTunes App Store</a>.
