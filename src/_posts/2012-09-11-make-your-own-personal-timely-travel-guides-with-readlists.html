Actually planning your trip can be a real chore. Some people just grab their stuff and go, but a lot of us like to do research before taking off.

In the past we lugged around bulky travel guides, but now people are turning to the Internet more and more for up-to-date travel information they can keep right in their pocket. With <a title="Readlists" href="http://readlists.com/">Readlists</a>, you can easily take the articles and blog posts you've found scattered around the Web and create your own personal travel ebook.

<a title="Manhattan Travel Guide" href="http://readlists.com/008a64b0/">Here's one</a> for Manhattan—heart of the bustling city we love, and where Readability calls home. This user collected a few travel articles, dropped them in, and they were good to go. It doesn't have to end there, though. You can add your own links to cover events or sights that you're interested in, like a writeup of that museum show you want to visit, or a review of that new food truck you want to scope out. The sky's the limit.

When you compile your own personal travel ebook with Readlists, you only get the stuff you want. Then you can send it to your iPhone, iPad, Kindle, or other compatible device with the click of a button. We'll do the heavy lifting when it comes to technical stuff. You just have to remember to bring your trusty gadget and have a good time.

Bon voyage!
