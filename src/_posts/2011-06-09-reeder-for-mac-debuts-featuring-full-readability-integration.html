There are RSS reader apps out there and then there's <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, Silvio Rizzi's beautiful Google Reader client for iPhone and iPad. Today marks the release of Reeder for Mac OS, bringing Reeder's unparalleled experience to Macs everywhere. 

While there are a slew of great features in Reeder for Mac, it's an especially great release for us because it includes full Readability integration right in the app. Not only can you turn on reading view and send any entries into your Readability reading list, but you can log right into your Readability account with Reeder and use it as full-fledged desktop client for Readability.
