In the era of web overload, the curators have come to our rescue. From our friends at <a href="http://longform.org">Longform</a> (and their great <a href="http://longformapp.com">iPad app</a>) to Maria Popova's consistently fun <a href="http://brainpickings.org">Brain Pickings</a>, they pluck out the bits we to want to read and save us from an avalanche of articles and links.

<img class="alignleft" title="NextDraft" src="http://i.imgur.com/VweEA.png" alt="NextDraft" width="200" />In that vein, one of our favorite daily newsletters is Dave Pell's <a href="http://nextdraft.com/">NextDraft</a>. By submitting your email address, you get great stuff to read wrapped in Dave's engaging and witty summaries.

And now there's the NextDraft app for the iPhone. It delivers NextDraft's daily summaries right to the palm of your hand. It's a lovely little app, great for when you need something to read but don't have the time to hunt through your Twitter feed or Facebook stream.

We're proud to announce that the reading view in NextDraft for iPhone is powered by Readability. You can even send choice articles right to your Readability reading list (along with Pocket and Instapaper).

NextDraft for iPhone is free. If you own an iPhone, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextdraft-days-most-fascinating/id549358690">go get it!</a>
