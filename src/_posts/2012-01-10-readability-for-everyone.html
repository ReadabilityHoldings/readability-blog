We have some great news to share: we've removed the limits on free Readability accounts. All users—free and paying—now get unlimited access to their Reading List, Favorites, Archives, and all our other features.

I wanted to take a quick minute to run through our motivations for the changes. This tweak helps us accomplish our goals in two ways:

First, we wanted to better distinguish the difference between having access to features and supporting content creation. As supporting great writing on the web is one of our key goals, having features tied to our support platform felt like it was muddling the message. So now they're distinct: all features are free, and supporting writing still exists as a platform.

Second, we wanted to keep Readability as open as possible so that third-party integrators to our service can access all of our features as well, without limitations. More and more, Readability is becoming the piping around reading experiences on the web. Apps like <a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a>, <a href="http://longform.org">Longform</a>, and others are tightly integrating with the Readability API to access readable content and reading lists. We love partners like this, and opening up our platform so that any application can create a reading list for a user, and access readable content, is another one of our key goals.

With those motivations in mind, we’re currently decoupling application features and supporting publishers (and Readability). “Premium” is now becoming “Subscriber”, and the dollars you can now optionally pay are purely for supporting us and writers, rather than to avoid the pain of any software-imposed limits we previously had.

We hope you enjoy the newly opened Readability. We're blown away by the thousands of you who have chosen to support writers through our platform, and we're committed to developing new ways for Readability Subscribers to encourage and consume great writing on the web. 

Happy Reading!
