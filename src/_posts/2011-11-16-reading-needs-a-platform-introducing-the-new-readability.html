We’ve been fairly quiet for the last few months here at Readability HQ, and for good reason: today we’re unveiling an expansion of our service that is going to change the way you read the web.

Wherever you read — your browser, iPhone, iPad, your Amazon Kindle — Readability is going to be there. For free.
<h5>Yes, Free</h5>
With this release, Readability is available at no cost. Sign-up and you’ll have your own profile and reading list in no time. Both Readability accounts and our companion apps will always be completely free, but we also offer a premium experience for users who want additional features and an easy way to support their favorite writers and publishers.
<h5>iOS, Here We Come!</h5>
Readability is on its way to the iTunes App Store. Our new apps for the iPhone and iPad are free and undeniably beautiful. We've partnered with the design wizards at <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com">Teehan+Lax</a> to deliver a simple, elegant experience featuring gorgeous typography from some of the best in type: <a href="http://www.typography.com/">Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones</a>. There’s never been a better way to read the web on iOS. Readability for iOS is submitted and awaiting approval from Apple.

<h5>A New Web Mobile Experience</h5>
From day one we've been committed to delivering the full Readability experience on the rich mobile web. We've completely revamped Readability to work beautifully within the web browser on smartphones and tablets. Built from the ground up as a rich HTML5 web application, web mobile Readability brings many of the conveniences of native apps to your smartphone’s browser, including complete offline support.
<h5>A reading <em>platform</em></h5>
We’ve always seen Readability as more than just a tool or an app. Wherever you’re finding, reading, and sharing great writing, we want Readability to be by your side. So, in addition to the free tools we’ve made available to writers and publishers, we’re opening the entire Readability feature set — including our world-class parser — to anyone interested in innovating around the reading experience. Our goal is to enable publishers and developers to enrich their own services and apps with Readability.

Today, that means your Readability list is available within incredible apps like <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> and <a href="http://www.tweetmagapp.com">TweetMag</a> — and that's just the beginning. Expect major announcements in the near future about new partnerships and apps joining the Readability family. Check back here or <a href="http://twitter.com/readability" target="_blank">follow us on Twitter</a> to get the latest updates.

We believe there has never been a better time to be a reader, and we're excited to be part of the revolution around the written word on the web.

Happy reading!
