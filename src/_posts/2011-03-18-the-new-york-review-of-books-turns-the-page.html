Readability was built from the ground up to embrace publishers of every shape, size, and definition. From the humble blog comment to the status update on up, all we produce and consume online is content: by extension (as <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2011/03/15/web-design-is-publishing/">web professionals know</a>), everyone is a de facto publisher on the web. Allowing readers to reward the publishers and writers they read most just feels right to us, and so Readability does not discriminate between publishers—no matter their pedigree or price of entry—whether it’s a cat blog or nytimes.com.

Yet not every publisher is the <em><a href="http://nybooks.com/">New York Review of Books</a></em>, which today sports the Readability button throughout its site.

We believe the pleasures of anywhere, anytime reading are only beginning to find their natural, wider audience with established readerships like the <em>Review</em>’s. Astute publishers, for their part, recognize the prevailing modes of content discovery and consumption are changing rapidly online. Readability offers a revenue-positive path for them to stay connected to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01read.html?ref=technology">shift</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/02/making_web_legible">afoot</a> (all digital reading is becoming "read later" reading), and allows readers the freedom of enjoying and sharing great content on a range of devices, at no cost or inconvenience to publishers. Publishers, for their part, gain insight into how their content is being consumed across our platform, online and off.

We are especially pleased the <em>Review</em> is stepping out publicly with us at a time when some publishers, faced with manifold challenges, are re-entrenching in legacy business models or retreating from the promise of the web. The <em>Review </em>itself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Review_of_Books">was born</a> in a time of industry transition; it's only fitting they understand the importance of addressing readers' needs—on readers' own terms.

The ongoing reinvention of the publishing industry will be a journey of many successive steps, big and small. The principle of putting readers first airs a resounding note of respect for what readers clearly want, and for where they are already—in digital droves toting phones and e-readers—taking the reading experience.

As for us, we're looking forward to sharing more of the fruits of our collaborative efforts with publishers. There's much more to come.

Watch this space.
