Since day one, Readability users have requested tagging more than any other feature, hands down. And today we’re making it happen.
<h5>Content, Meet Tags <a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tag-flyout-02.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3729" title="tag-flyout-02" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tag-flyout-02.png" alt="" width="320" height="140" /></a></h5>
Tagging is now baked into your web-based reading list and saved articles, so you can organize and navigate content the way you want, when you want. Our new tagging functionality sports the kind of fast, intuitive interface you've come to expect from Readability.

<a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sidebar-tags-01.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3732" title="sidebar-tags-01" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sidebar-tags-01.png" alt="" width="220" height="322" /></a>When you <a href="http://www.readability.com">log into Readability</a> on the web you'll find all your tags displayed in the reading list sidebar, where you can click to instantly filter your reading list or quickly delete tags you're finished using. We keep things tidy by showing your 10 most-used tags by default, but you can expand it to see your full list. We’ll remember to leave it open when you come back (or log into your account from another computer).

On top of that, we’ve got all the features you’ve come to expect from tagging, including a smart autcomplete based on your existing tags. And yes, spaces and special characters are okay!

We’ll also be rolling out full <a href="http://www.readability.com/developers">support for tagging in our API</a> shortly, giving the thousands of developers who’ve already plugged into the Readability platform access to even more powerful tools.
<h5><strong>The Best Reading Platform is Growing</strong></h5>
Readability's goal is simple: build the best reading platform anywhere, period. We’re making that happen by building even more tools to help our users read, curate, share, and organize their content, and making our best-in-class parsing engine and API even smarter every single day.
