If you're wondering what to snatch up for this holiday season's gift-giving, consider one more resounding vote for the Amazon Kindle Fire. The little elves at Readability are hard at work building a killer reading app the likes of which Android devices have never seen:

We've taken great care to bring a clean, elegant reading experience and beautiful typography to Android tablets and smart phones. Development is well under way and we hope to have it in everyone's hands soon.

As for all you iOS fans out there, the Readability for iOS app is done and in Apple's hands awaiting approval. We'll let everyone know as soon as its available on iTunes.

Happy holidays!
