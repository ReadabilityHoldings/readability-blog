Editor's Note: The following is a guest post from Jeffrey Zeldman, founder and publisher of <em>A List Apart</em> magazine, announcing the release of <a href="http://readlists.com/cc0d2783/">a special Readlist to accompany their 356th issue</a>.
<blockquote><em>A List Apart</em> explores the design, development, and meaning of web content, with a special focus on web standards and best practices. It started in 1997 as a digest-only mailing list (hence "A List Apart"), becoming a magazine "for people who make websites" in 1998, and a registered periodical (ISSN: 1534-0295) as soon as the Library of Congress realized "blogs" were publications, and publishing was publishing, whether in pixels or on paper. You see, we have had these conversations before.

Pardon my braggadocio, but in 15 years online, we have led the key movements in web design, UX, and web content; discovered and presented nearly all the important authors; and published most the definitive pieces in the industry's history (along with plenty of others that were simply very good).

For our 356th issue—also the last issue helmed by departing editor-in-chief Krista Stevens—we set ourselves the task of selecting our favorite pieces from the preceding 355 issues. A Book Apart's Mandy Brown and Jason Santa Maria helped me make the first pass through all the magazine's prior content. Krista Stevens organized the material. I reorganized it and took a final pass, killing some children and bringing others onto the lifeboat.

The incomparable Kevin Cornell illustrated the resulting <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/summer-reading-issue/">Summer Reading Issue</a>; Jason Santa Maria colorized it; and then we were done. Or, almost.

This best-of-15-years collection deserved to be a book, and thanks to Readlists (and <em>A List Apart</em> staff producer Tim Murtaugh, who beat me to the punch), <a href="http://readlists.com/cc0d2783/">now it is one</a>.

If Readlists did not exist, it would be necessary to invent it. As the founder and publisher of <em>A List Apart</em> (and, coincidentally, as an advisor to Readability) I cannot think of a better consummation for ALA's most important works than to find themselves joined in an epub, suitable for beach (or even home and office) reading. Thank you, Readability, for your creative bounty, and thank you, past and present <em>A List Apart</em> authors, editors, designers, and producers, for elevating the profession.
