Today we're releasing the latest version of Readability for iOS. This update introduces a smarter interface, featuring a completely revamped menu system. We've replaced the dropdowns and custom header toggles with sliding cards that get you where you need to go with fewer taps. Check out the demo video and you'll see what we mean.

We've also vastly improved the speed and reliability of sync, and made sure everything is shipshape for iOS 6. When the latest version of Apple's device operating system ships next week, you'll be ready with the most rock-solid Readability yet on your iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.
