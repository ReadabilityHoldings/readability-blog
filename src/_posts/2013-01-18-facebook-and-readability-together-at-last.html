We're excited to announce the latest version of Readability with Facebook integration. Now, you can automatically share what you're reading with your friends by connecting your Facebook account. Once connected and turned on, articles sent to your queue are also shared with your friends. Also, if you favorite an article in Readability, it registers as a Facebook "Like". If you're worried about cluttering your friends' Facebook streams, rest assured. Multiple articles will be grouped into a single, neat Facebook post.

Registered users of Readability can link their account to Facebook by visiting their <a href="http://www.readability.com/account/connections/">Connections page</a>. Down the road, we plan to continue to enhance the social experience of reading on Readability. We're committed to not only delivering the best reading experience around but the best social experience around what you're reading. Stay tuned!
