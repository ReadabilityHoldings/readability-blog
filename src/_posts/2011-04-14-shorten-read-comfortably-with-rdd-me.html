Thanks to Twitter and the claustrophobic constraint of 140 characters, link shorteners have become a common part of sharing links on the web. There's something oddly satisfying about scrunching up an unwieldy link down to just a handful of characters.

Today, we're announcing the availability of yet another URL shortener with a convenient little twist: <a href="http://rdd.me">rdd.me</a>: 

<a href="http://rdd.me"><img src="/wp-content/themes/rdb/images/rdd.png" alt="rdd.me" /></a>

It works like any other link-shortener except for one very important distinction: it bakes the power and convenience of Readability right into the link. If anyone opens an rdd.me link, they'll see a reading view option up top that lets them turn on Readability. If they open the link on a mobile device, a lightweight mobile version of Readability kicks in to present the page in a clean reading view. Rdd.me is even smart enough to leave alone web pages that don't need an optimized reading view.

Through her popular <a href="http://twitter.com/brainpicker">@brainpicker</a> Twitter account, Maria will be using rdd.me as the shortener of choice for all that great article content that she discovers and shares. 

<a href="http://rdd.me">Rdd.me</a> is free for anyone to use and share. A Readability account is not required. So what are you waiting for? Go forth and shorten...and read comfortably!
