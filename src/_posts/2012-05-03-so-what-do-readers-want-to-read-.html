Last week, to celebrate Longform's second anniversary, we took a look at the most read stories in the history of the site. We've posted nearly 3,000 articles thus far, and we wanted to see why some are clicked so much more than others. You're not going to believe what we found. Sitting down?

People like stories about sex. A lot.

Articles from the sex section were nine times more likely to get read than the average piece on the site. But there was another conclusion we pulled out from the data, one that wasn't nearly as predictable. Turns out, our audience doesn't care much about where a story is published—bigger, more popular sites didn't really move the needle. People don't even care <em>when</em> a story is published—classic pieces are clicked just as much, if not more, than new ones. Ultimately, what we saw in the numbers was that people decide which stories to read based on topic. That's it. All that matters are the words on the screen.

Sound familiar?

What makes Readability such a powerful tool, and such a perfect partner for Longform, is that it democratizes content. In other words, it levels the playing field in publishing, putting the source in the background and the topic front and center. 

Yes, the primary goal of removing distractions—links to other stories, logos, bright blinking lights of all shapes and sizes—is to let readers fully and completely engage with a piece of writing. But focusing solely on the text of an article also radically changes we compare one piece to another. All of a sudden, a post on a personal blog looks exactly the same as an op-ed in a major newspaper. Inducing that next pageview doesn't matter. SEO doesn't matter. With Readability, every article is created equal. And when you've established that baseline, you can start to truly see what people want to read.   

On Longform, we found that people wanted to read about sex. Murder, too. Famous writers were more likely to get clicks, political stories almost never crack our most-read lists, and people mostly go for sports articles when they're about a fallen star. You can see all the data from our first two years <a href="http://longform.tumblr.com/post/21849537720/two-years-of-longform-what-the-hell-did-we-just-read">here</a>, but keep in mind: we're only working with a tiny fraction of the reading material on the web.

What if you could look at the choices readers make across, say, millions of domains? What would writers and editors learn about their audiences? What would readers learn about themselves? 

How much incredible new reading material would we discover?

Over the coming weeks and months, we'll be working with Readability to dive into the numbers and start answering those questions. We can't wait to share what we find.

Stay tuned.
