Today we're announcing a partnership with one of the most popular news-reading apps out there: <a href="http://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a>. Pulse transforms your favorite websites into a colorful, interactive mosaic and has led the way on iOS and Android since the day it launched. We're thrilled to be working with their fantastic team to bring the full power of Readability to the Pulse experience.

So, starting now,  you can add your Readability Reading List to your Pulse page:

It's a simple way to catch up on your queue without having to leave the Pulse app. And once you've added Readability, starring an article inside Pulse will automatically add it to your Readability Reading List. Now you can scan the best content on the web and save interesting stuff for later, all in one place. Finally, as part of our collaboration, Pulse has adopted Readability's world-class parser to enhance the reading experience for all of their millions of users.

Making our reading lists available wherever people read is just one of the ways we're transforming Readability from a service to a platform. We relish the chance to work with incredible teams like the one behind Pulse, so if you're doing interesting things that could benefit from an integrated reading list or a top-notch parser, <a href="http://www.readability.com/contact">get in touch</a>. And keep posted for lots of big announcements to come.

Pulse is free and <a href="http://www.pulse.me/">available on the iPhone, iPad and Android</a>.
