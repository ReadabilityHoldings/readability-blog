<h2>Readability Everywhere</h2>
To get the most of Readability you can add it to all your devices and computers. That way, you'll be able to access or add to your reading list from anywhere. It's available for iPhone, iPad, mobile Web, your favourite Web browser, Kindle, Twitter clients, RSS readers and more. 
