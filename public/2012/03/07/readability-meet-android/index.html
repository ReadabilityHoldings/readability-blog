                    The response to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8">Readability for iOS</a> blew us away. It was a long time coming, but we couldn't have asked for a better reception. We've got some great improvements coming so if you own an iPhone or iPad, by all means <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8">go get it</a>.

Readability at its core is a service and platform. Our goal is to make reading great on any platform, device or app, including our own. In that same spirit we're thrilled to announce that <a href="http://www.readability.com/android">Readability for Android devices</a> will be available on Monday, March 12.

We went to great lengths to bring the same polished, content-centric experience in iOS to Android devices. It sports the same beautiful typography by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones and even scales up nicely to handle larger Android devices like the Kindle Fire.

We're convinced that Readability for Android will stand tall among Android apps. It's a level of polish rarely seen on the platform and we can't wait to get it into your hands on Monday.
