We know a lot of you have been waiting for this. We couldn't be more excited to deliver it. <img class="aligncenter" title="Readability for iOS" src="http://i.imgur.com/1zAkd.png" alt="" width="500" />Readability for iOS is the product of a collaboration between the Readability team and the talented designers and builders at <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com">Teehan+Lax</a>. It also sports beautiful typography from none other than <a href="http://www.typography.com/">Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones</a>.
