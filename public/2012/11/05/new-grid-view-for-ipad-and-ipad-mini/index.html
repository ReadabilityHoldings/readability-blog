                    Today we’re adding a great new viewing option for Top Reads and Longform content on your iPad and iPad mini. It's called Grid View.

<a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/top-reads-ipad-mini-01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3686" title="top-reads-ipad-mini-01" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/top-reads-ipad-mini-01.png" alt="" width="520" height="412" /></a>

Grid View gives readers a more inviting, visual way to discover new content in Readability, and it’s the perfect complement to <a title="Top Reads" href="http://readability.com/top-reads/">our redesigned Top Reads website</a>. So now you have two great new ways to check out the latest snapshot of what the entire Web is reading.

Under the hood, it's powered by the same smart layout engine our partners at Teehan+Lax built for their own TweetMag app. We've taken the best of what they learned and married it to the great content our users are discovering and enjoying with Readability every day.

You can <a title="iTunes App Store: Readability" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8">grab the latest version of Readability for iOS</a>, featuring Grid View, in the App Store now.
