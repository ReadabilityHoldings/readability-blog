                    In the era of web overload, the curators have come to our rescue. From our friends at <a href="http://longform.org">Longform</a> (and their great <a href="http://longformapp.com">iPad app</a>) to Maria Popova's consistently fun <a href="http://brainpickings.org">Brain Pickings</a>, they pluck out the bits we to want to read and save us from an avalanche of articles and links.

<img class="alignleft" title="NextDraft" src="http://i.imgur.com/VweEA.png" alt="NextDraft" width="200" />In that vein, one of our favorite daily newsletters is Dave Pell's <a href="http://nextdraft.com/">NextDraft</a>.

And now there's the NextDraft app for the iPhone. It delivers NextDraft's daily summaries right to the palm of your hand. It's a lovely little app, great for when you need something to read but don't have the time to hunt through your Twitter feed or Facebook stream.
