He's also an important part of the Readability family, helping advise on strategy and guide the work with our own <a href="http://readability.com/ios">iOS</a> and <a href="http://readability.com/android">Android</a> apps. As a designer, journalist, and former ad man, he knows a thing or two about content and publishing.

He spoke earlier this week at the <a href="https://twitter.com/innovatenews">Innovate News</a> meetup about the Readability platform and its relevance to the shifting media landscape. We caught up with him after to get his thoughts on the topic.

<h4>As a founder and a partner, how would you describe your role at Teehan+Lax?</h4>
My role has changed since <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/author/admin/">Geoff</a> and I started the company 10 years ago. When we started, Geoff and I were creative partners working on client business together. As we grew we needed to divide and conquer, so we each took on clients that suited our skills. Two years ago we had about forty people, and at the time no one was running the company. It was causing problems, so I stopped working on clients and took on the role of management. That role consists of setting the vision for the company, making sure there is enough money in the bank, and dealing with operational issues.

I also help our teams think through client problems and I am very involved with our <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/labs/">Labs group</a>. I want to move back into doing more creative work in 2013, it is something I miss.
<h4>Does your background in media and advertising influence the work you do now? Is it still relevant? If so, how?</h4>
The things I learned working at a magazine right out of journalism school were very influential. At the magazine I learned how to do editorial print layout from the creative director. He taught me because I knew Quark and I was good with a computer (a surprisingly rare skill in 1994). His basic crash course in typography and layout gave me a foundational knowledge of design. He also taught me how to deconstruct graphic design. Being forced to lay out a magazine when you are 21 is a phenomenal crash course in design. As I moved into advertising and then ultimately into managing designers and the design process, that foundation was important.

In the past few years we've been lucky enough to work on a variety of media related projects for publishers and products like Readability. My schooling and time in the publishing industry provide a good context for making decisions on editorial products we are involved with. While I don't practice journalism anymore, I'm still a keen watcher and interested in the shifts occurring in journalism and media.
<h4>…and advertising?</h4>
Advertising is a bit more of a complicated relationship. Over the years I've become increasingly disenchanted with advertising. While there is a portion of the work we do here at Teehan + Lax that is advertising, we don't consider ourselves an advertising agency. I think when advertising is executed at the highest level it is indistinguishable from a product or a service. Nike+ is a really good example of that, it blurs the line between product and advertising. When you tweet "i just ran…" you are advertising Nike+ but it feels like a service.

Unfortunately most advertising is display advertising, which i don't like very much. I really want us to find something better.
<h4>What did you learn about designing publishing apps during your work on Readability?</h4>
We spent a lot of time thinking about the reading experience when designing Readability. In other publishing projects we spent more time thinking about how to keep users on the site or maximizing ad impressions. I think what I learned is that publishing apps should spend more time thinking about the content experience for the user. I think that is something we would stress on future projects. I would like the reader to put down the app and feel like they had a great experience and enjoyed reading it.

I used to regularly have that feeling with magazines. I remember being so excited to get the latest issue of <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/">Wired</a> and would pore over it. I don't have that feeling with editorial websites or the majority of publishing apps. Although sites like <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/">The Great Discontent</a> and <a href="http://www.grantland.com/">Grantland</a> are exceptions.
<h4>The idea of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/orbital-content/">orbital content</a> is central to platforms like Readability. What are your thoughts on that and where it might be going?</h4>
I think that all content in the digital realm atomizes. Albums atomize to singles, newspapers and magazines atomize to stories, MTV becomes Vevo videos. Content becomes atomic and once it does, it becomes orbital. We need to accept this and move on.

Technology moves people from being passive consumers to active customers. Over time, I see these phenomena accelerating. The multi-screen universe we live in wants our content to be available when we want, how we want, and where we want. So, your move, content creator.

Content producers who create content that is designed to be orbital will have an easier time gaining a vantage point from where they can see future opportunities.
<h4>It's a challenging environment out there for traditional publishers right now. Plenty of discussion focuses on the down sides of the digital transition. But what do you think are some of the biggest opportunities?</h4>
The music industry is a great example to look to for an idea of what can happen. When Napster eviscerated the music company's monopoly, everyone was drawing a chalk line around the whole industry. But the reality is that the money just moved. It moved to live performance and 360 deals. It moved to Apple and Amazon. There were casualties, like Tower Records, and the record companies aren't making the kind of money they were, but music is still around and great music is still being produced.

I think that publishers are going through a similar thing. The money isn't gone, it just moved and we don't exactly know where to yet. There will be casualties of this shift. Some institutions that we have great fondness for will not exist in the future, but new opportunities will exist.

There are interesting opportunities for publishers using technologies to create communities of interest rather than just audience. People will pay to be part of a community. <a href="http://www.vice.com/">Vice</a> has created a community as much as they have created an audience and it is very profitable for them.
