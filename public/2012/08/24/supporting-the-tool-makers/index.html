                    Yesterday <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2012/08/supporting-content-in-the-public-interest/">we announced</a> that the first of our three final Publisher Payment program donations was going to ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning non-profit newsroom and a driving force for innovative, high quality journalism. This next donation speaks to the tool makers, whose work is an essential connection between author and audience.

<a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/django-logo.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2920" title="django-logo" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/django-logo.png" alt="" width="142" height="61" /></a>Today we’re pleased to announce that we’re donating another $10,000, this time to the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django Software Foundation</a>.

An open source Web development framework originally created by a team at the parent company of the <em>Lawrence Journal-World</em> newspaper, Django was born from content. Since then it’s gone on to power a host of major services, including the likes of Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest, and yes, Readability.

From our platform's <a href="http://www.readability.com/developers/api">core API</a>, to the Reading View view enjoyed by millions of users, we rely on Django day in, day out. And it delivers.

The original creators of Django saw fit to release their work as open source, allowing an entire community to benefit. Their idea, and the dedication of the volunteers who've helped grow it since then, has enabled folks like us at Readability. We’re thrilled to be giving something back to help enable them.
