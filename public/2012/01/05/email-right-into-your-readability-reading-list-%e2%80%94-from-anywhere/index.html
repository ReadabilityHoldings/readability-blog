                    Readability's <a href="http://www.readability.com/addons">browser add-ons</a> are an incredibly popular way to read comfortably within your favorite browser and save web articles for reading later. Still, browsing these days has taken on a whole new meaning. We're browsing inside of Twitter clients and news apps. We're browsing on our mobile phones and tablets. The "browser" as we know it is giving way to all sorts of new ways to browse and discover content.

Regardless of what app or device you're using, we wanted to make it incredibly easy to send articles into your reading list. Starting today, every Readability account includes its own special email address. If you're already signed up, <a href="http://www.readability.com/account/email">you can find yours here</a>. To add any web article to your reading list, simply send an email with one or more web links to your assigned email address and it'll automatically be added.
