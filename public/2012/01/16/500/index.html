                    Lots of apps and services love to throw around the big stats. "We've just reached our millionth..." or "X million downloads!" It's a common headline on tech blog sites. For us at Readability, there's one stat that just crept up on us that we're really psyched about.

Since our launch less than a year ago, we've given away over <em>500 API keys</em> to partners, developers and publishers. While it doesn't sounds as sexy as "hundreds of thousands" or "millions" (though we've got plenty of those as well), this number carries special meaning for us.

We always viewed Readability as more than just a web app and browser add-on. For us, it represents an enabling technology that elevates the reading experience within and beyond the web browser and into other apps and devices.  From great Twitter clients like <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> to the amazing integration in <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for iOS and OSX, we're blown away by all the time and energy others are investing in Readability.

If you're a publisher or developer, we'd love to work with you to further enhance and enrich the reading experience within your app or publication. We've worked hard to make <a href="http://www.readability.com/publishers/api">our API</a> incredibly easy to work with and as low-overhead as possible. You can <a href="http://www.readability.com/publishers/api">check it out here</a>. If you're interested, <a href="http://www.readability.com/contact">get in touch</a> and we'll provide you with your own keys to Readability.

While we're excited about what the next 500 developers bring to the Readability story, we just want to thank the developers and partners that have helped turn Readability from an app into a true movement around reading.
