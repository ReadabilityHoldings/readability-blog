                    It must seem like every post on this blog these days is about yet another implementation of Readability. And while we've got a lot more to say about reading and the platform in general, we'll admit we get pretty giddy when we see others bring Readability to life inside their apps and services—especially integration as thorough as in <a href="http://www.glasshouseapps.com/apps.html#t1">The Early Edition 2</a> for the iPad.

The Early Edition delivers an elegant, newspaper-like experience across various topics of your choosing. Find an article you want to read and a quick swipe up brings up the Readability shoebox. You can access your entire Readability list, favorites and archives right from within the app.

The Early Edition 2 is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-early-edition-2/id471813327?mt=8">$2.99 on iTunes</a>. If you've already got a Readability account—and if you don't, <a href="https://www.readability.com/readers/register">what are you waiting for?</a>—it's yet another great way to read the web comfortably.
