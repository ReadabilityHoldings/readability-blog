                    The experience of opening and reading links via Twitter on your mobile phone is less than ideal. Web pages just aren't designed to handle all the shapes and sizes of devices you're reading on—or at least they weren't. Today that changes.

<img class="alignleft" title="Tweetbot" src="http://i.imgur.com/yz7aS.png" alt="Tweetbot" width="80" />We're thrilled to announce a partnership with one of the most beautifully designed Twitter clients out there: <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> for iPhone. Now, when you open a shared link from within Tweetbot, with one flip of the switch you can transform the page into a clean, Readability-powered reading view.
<img class="aligncenter" title="Tweetbot Mobilizer" src="http://i.imgur.com/UVFGw.png" alt="Tweetbot Mobilizer" />Of course, you can also send articles to your Readability Reading List from within Tweetbot and <a href="http://readability.com/apps">many other Twitter clients</a>, but with the Readability mobile view, the Tweetbot reading experience just got a whole lot better.

This integration highlights yet another way that Readability is enhancing the reading experience, whether it's on your browser or on your device. If you're building an app or service that could take advantage of Readability's powerful parser and mobilizer capabilities, <a href="http://www.readability.com/contact">we'd love to hear from you</a>.

You can <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id428851691?mt=8">purchase Tweetbot</a> on iTunes. Happy reading...in Tweetbot!

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: The Tweetbot guys just pulled a “one more thing” on all of us and released <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/tweetbot-twitter-client-personality/id498801050?mt=8">Tweetbot for iPad</a>, with Readability support as well—go get it!
