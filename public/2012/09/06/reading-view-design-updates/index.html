Yesterday we rolled out further refinements to our Reading View, featuring a slimmer, more useful toolbar. Sharing actions, accessed by thousands of Readability users every day, are now located right on the toolbar instead of hidden several clicks away. In addition, settings menus now feature a cleaner, more legible design. We've also added the ability to export any article to ePub format with a single click, ready for use in your favorite compatible reading device.

When it comes to creating the best reading experience on the Web, we know it's the little things that make the biggest difference. We hope you enjoy these updates. Happy reading!
