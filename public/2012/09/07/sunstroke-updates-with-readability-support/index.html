Every day folks are plugging into the rapidly expanding universe of apps, sites, and services that take advantage of Readability’s flexibility and reach, and they’re all doing it in different ways.

<a title="Sunstroke" href="https://goneeast.com/sunstroke/">Sunstroke</a>, the first iPhone client for Shaun Inman’s <a title="Fever" href="http://feedafever.com">Fever</a>, just released it’s latest update, including support for Readability. “Readability has been one of the most popular requests,” Sunstroke developer Anthony Drendel told us. “As a developer, adding support for sending articles to Readability was simple. The <a href="http://www.readability.com/developers/api">API documentation</a> was easy to understand and very thorough. I especially liked that Readability uses XAuth.
