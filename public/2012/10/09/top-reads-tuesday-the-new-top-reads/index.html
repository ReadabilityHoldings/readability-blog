                    <a href="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/top-reads-collage-A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3473" title="top-reads-collage-A" src="http://blog-assets.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/top-reads-collage-A.png" alt="" width="230" height="262" /></a>Back in July, we launched <a title="Top Reads on Readability" href="http://readability.com/top-reads/">Top Reads</a>, our constantly updated snapshot of what’s popular on the Readability platform. Today, we're proud to announce a new version of <a title="Top Reads on Readability" href="http://www.readability.com/top-reads/">Top Reads</a> that brings its design on level with its data. With the help of our team’s clever code, we’re automatically surfacing the pieces Readability users are engaging with the most. And the data isn't just from our own website and apps. It's coming from the entire universe of Readability-powered apps, sites, and services built with <a title="Readability API" href="http://www.readability.com/developers/api">our API</a>—including heavy hitters like <a title="Pulse" href="https://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a>, <a title="Tweetbot" href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>, and <a title="Reeder" href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>.
<h5>Top Reads Gets Visual</h5>
Now you can browse Top Reads from the last <a title="Top Reads in the last hour" href="http://www.readability.com/top-reads/?within=hour">hour</a>, <a title="Top Reads in the last day" href="http://www.readability.com/top-reads/?within=day">day</a>, or <a title="Top Reads in the last week" href="http://www.readability.com/top-reads/?within=week">week</a> in a beautiful editorial layout. We think it will help our users find cool and interesting things to read at a glance. We're also psyched to delve deeper into <a title="TypeKit" href="https://typekit.com/">TypeKit</a> with this release (for the designers out there, we're using <a title="Abril Display on TypeKit" href="https://typekit.com/fonts/abril-display/ ">Abril Display</a> for titling and <a title="Abril Text on TypeKit" href="https://typekit.com/fonts/abril-text/">Abril Text</a> for body copy). These touches are a sign of things to come as we roll out more changes to our products.
<h5>Readability Loves Responsive Web Design</h5>
Our Design Lead <a title="Tyler Gaw" href="http://twitter.com/thegaw/">Tyler Gaw</a> has a soft spot for Responsive Web Design, and we don't blame him. Top Reads is flexible, and works with you—rather than making you work with it—across different devices and their varying shapes and sizes. So whether you're checking out what's popular on the Readability platform on your 30-inch monitor, smartphone, or tablet, it'll look great while giving you great things to read.

We hope you enjoy the new Top Reads.
