                    When purchasing a new appliance or device, the first thing most of us do is read the instructions. Take the <a title="AeroPress" href="http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm">AeroPress</a>, a nifty coffee brewing device, for instance. Its instructions are simple, and that's part of its charm, but if you do some research online, you'll find they're only the beginning.

After experimenting and developing new techniques for better brewing, enthusiasts share their findings online. There's a lot of great information out there, but it's all over the place. A <a title="Readlists" href="http://readlists.com/">Readlists</a> user, <a title="eimer's Readlists" href="http://readlists.com/user/eimer/">eimer</a>, decided to pull some of the best articles he found together to make his own <a title="Intro to AeroPress" href="http://readlists.com/c0c12ebe/">Intro to AeroPress</a> instruction manual.

With the holiday season well on its way, there's a good chance you'll find yourself stuck reading incomplete or unsatisfactory instructions. With a little research, and the help of <a title="Readlists" href="http://readlists.com/">Readlists</a>, you can do better.Â And since you can send your improved instruction manual to your iPhone, iPad, Kindle, or other compatible device with the click of a button, you'll never have to worry about losing it in a drawer somewhere.
