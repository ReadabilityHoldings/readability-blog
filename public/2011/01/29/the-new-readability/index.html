                    Months ago on the Arc90 blog, we talked about <a href="http://blog.arc90.com/2010/06/10/why-we-built-readability/">why we built Readability</a>. In that post. we shared some insights into some of the ideas that guided our thinking as we moved the platform forward.

Since  then, it's been an interesting time for reading on the web and  publishing in general. We've seen important conversations bubble up that  not only address the reading experience but also the quality and nature  of web content itself. All the while, publishers are experimenting with  new ways to extract value.
<h2>Enjoy Reading</h2>
Today, <a href="http://www.readability.com/">Readability</a> graduates from basic web reading tool to a full-blown reading platform.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104" title="screens" src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/screens.png" alt="" width="393" height="276" />

We're introducing a whole slew of <a href="http://www.readability.com/learn-more/">new features</a> to make reading on the web even better. Readability now works on mobile  phones and tablets and we now provide the ability to save a web article  for reading later. You can even share your reading list so that others  can follow what you're reading.

We’ve  put a lot of work into the existing free add-on as well. You can change  your appearance settings at any time (not just on install) and share a  Readability-enhanced link via Facebook, Twitter and email.
<h2>Support Writing</h2>
Beyond  reading features, we wanted to leverage the platform to support the  writers and publishers people enjoy on the web today. In other words, we  wanted to tie a mechanism that supports publishers to the act of reading. It’s easier done than said. As we embarked on this new path, a voice rang from across the Atlantic that beautifully echoed our motivation and sentiment.

John Lanchester in the <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n24/john-lanchester/let-us-pay">London Review of Books</a>:
<blockquote>I  feel equally certain in saying that what the print media need[…]is a  new payment mechanism for online reading, which lets you read anything  you like, wherever it is published, and then charges you on an  aggregated basis, either monthly or yearly or whatever[…]

I also want to  feel free to read anything else which catches my eye, whenever I feel  like it – I just don’t want to have to think about paying every time I  click on the article to read it. I want a monthly or yearly charge,  taken off my credit card without my having to think about it.</blockquote>
We've never met John but we think his plea is dead-on. That’s exactly where we’re taking  Readability—

We're turning Readability into a monthly subscription service with a unique twist: the great majority of your fees (70%) will go directly to the writers and publishers you enjoy. We're  tethering a small, passive transaction to the reading decisions you make  through the platform. You can even publicly share the top domains  you're enjoying through Readability. It's a new type of badge: "I  support these writers &amp; publishers."

The minimum subscription fee for Readability is $5.00 a month. If you can  afford to pay more, we encourage you to do so. The more you pay, the  more you're supporting publishing on the web.

And  "on the web" is what Readability is all about. It's the unencumbered  web without speed bumps or toll booths to slow you down. For writers and  publishers, there is no approval process, no gatekeepers and no  hardware dependencies. It's the web with a quality reading experience  bolted on.

We’re even providing publishers and developers with a <a href="https://www.readability.com/publishers/tools/">suite of tools</a> to enhance the reading experience for their readers.

We recognize that on the web, everyone is a publisher. We've even created a handy little <a href="http://www.readability.com/developers/">embed button</a> that brings the Readability experience right to your readers.
<h2>A Match Made in Reading Heaven</h2>
Part  of the original inspiration for Readability is the exceptional iOS  reading application <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>. Today, we couldn't be more excited to  announce a our  partnership with Instapaper. Subscribers of Readability that own  iPhones or iPads can download Readability for iOS, powered by Instapaper.

As of this writing, the app hasn’t been approved on iTunes,  but look out for it in the coming days. We’ve got other big  announcements surrounding the Instapaper-Readability partnership in the  near future. Stay tuned.
<h2>Quality Content is Expensive</h2>
The  core motivator behind the new Readability is pretty straight-forward:  good, quality content is worth paying for and we shouldn’t have to rely  on any particular platform or device to do so. Readability represents an ambitious  attempt to reconcile the freedom and speed of the web with the need to pay for content that is worth paying for.

We  couldn't be more excited about the new Readability. We’ve got so much  more to announce in the coming days and weeks. You can stay in the loop  by following <a href="http://twitter.com/readability">@readability</a> on Twitter or checking back here on the Readability blog.

Happy reading!
