                    As the Readability launch was drawing near, there was still an important unanswered question for the Readability team: <em>what should the shortcut keys for the <a href="https://www.readability.com/addons/">browser add-ons</a> be?</em> We wanted something that would feel natural to readers. It needed to be quick and easy to use. We would have none of that finger-twisting key combination nonsense.

And so we took a walk up and down the keyboard. Just about every key combination felt awkward or was already reserved for other applications or functions. The function keys were a cop out, so we avoided those. After a few laps, it was just sitting there staring at us.

It is arguably the most neglected key on the U.S. English keyboard. Programmers call it the "backtick" or "backquote" key. The more official name is downright morbid, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent">grave accent</a>:

<a href="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/backtick.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249" title="backtick" src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/backtick.png" alt="" width="125" height="125" /></a>The <em>grave accent</em> key is comfortably sandwiched between the <em>Tab</em> and <em>Esc</em> keys. It literally sits on the edge of the keyboard, just waiting to be pressed (for reading now) or shift+pressed (for reading later). It wasn't just perfect. It was <em>addictive. </em>It felt good to not only deliver something incredibly handy and useful but to also bring a modicum of much-deserved respect and recognition to the g<em>rave accent</em> key.

<em>A humble note to non-U.S. keyboard users: </em>we are aware that the grave accent does not grace many non-U.S. English keyboards. In a future update to the browser add-ons, we plan to provide the ability to select your own shortcut key for Readability's functions.
