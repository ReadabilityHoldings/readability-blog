Fans of comfortable reading are finding news ways to encounter the Readability experience across the web. Here are three you may have spotted recently:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi">Google Chrome Web Store</a>: As we mentioned the other day, the official Readability extension has landed at Googleâ€”and to warm reviews already. ("One of the best add-ons I have ever installed!!") Our custom keyboard shortcuts are now available to all our Chrome users, regardless of where you downloaded Readability.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.echofon.com/">Echofon</a>: At your desktop or on the go, the widely-used Twitter client for iPhone, Firefox, and Mac now integrates directly with Readability. "Send to Readability" is also included.</li>
	<li><a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>: Young but already celebrated, Tweetbot is a versatile Twitter client that responded to early user requests by adding the ability to add links to your Readability reading list.</li>
</ul>
We're delighted to be keeping such good company.
