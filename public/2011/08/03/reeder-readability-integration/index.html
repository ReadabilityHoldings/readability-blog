                    A couple of months ago, we were <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/06/reeder-for-mac-debuts-featuring-full-readability-integration/">excited to announce</a> a partnership with <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> that brought much of Readability's functionality to Mac desktops. Today, Reeder - one of the most popular feed readers for iOS - brings full Readability functionality to the iPhone and iPad. 
<img src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/reeder.png" alt="" title="reeder" width="422" height="264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1336" />With Reeder 2.5 you can sync, read offline and manage your Readability reading list right inside of Reeder. We couldn't be happier to join forces with one of the best-selling and beautifully designed reading apps around. If you haven't experienced Reeder yet, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8">go get it on iTunes</a>. 

We've got more big announcements coming soon as we continue to partner and expand Readability's reach and usefulness. Until then, we hope you'll enjoy this great implementation of Readability.
