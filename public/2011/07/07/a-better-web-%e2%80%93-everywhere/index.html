                    There’s an important shift happening in the way we consume web content these days. From the beginning of the “web,” the almighty web browser enjoyed nearly exclusive status as the window to, well, the web. It’s still the primary view into how we find, read and watch just about everything.

Over the past couple of years, and more recently in more dramatic ways, the browser is being nudged aside by new an interesting ways to consume information. This shift is happening for a few reasons:
<ul>
	<li>With the success of the iPhone, iPad and the Android platform, we’ve seen an explosion of apps that wrap a new experience around web content. Apps like Flipboard, Pulse and many others provide a cleaner and more engaging experience that is more finely tailored to your needs.</li>

	<li>Until only a few years ago, your laptop or desktop computer dominated your internet experience. That’s changing. Tablets, phones with bigger screens and e-Readers are taking up more and more of our screen time.</li>

	<li>Finally, it’s worth noting that a thought shift around the reusability of web content took hold a couple of years ago, sparked in no small part by the availability of Readability. In short, Readability and similar tools liberated content from its sole intended use and opened up new opportunities and possibilities.</li></ul>Today, what’s materializing is a new breed of user behavior that diverges away from the almighty web page view. While we still whiz around the web via the web browser, we are committing large swaths of time on content we’ve decided to consume elsewhere. Whether it’s the Kindle on the commute home or your favorite reading app in bed, deep and meaningful engagement is increasingly happening outside the browser.
<h2>A New Metric</h2>
The foundational metrics that drive advertising and monetization around web content today - the page view, the ad impression and the click-through - are marginalized in these new contexts of consumption. Over the next few years, new meters will be installed that measure not only if you visited a particular piece of content, but how, when, where and for how long you engaged with it.

Your standard banner ad templates will experience similar pressure. As devices of all shapes and sizes eat into the traditional desktop experience, we’ll be forced to rethink advertising and marketing into these new “places” that people increasingly inhabit.
<h2>Enhancing the Web</h2>
As all this change occurs, it will be worthwhile to keep an eye on the web. While the web browser is being challenged, the basic tenets of what make the web so great should be guarded as we journey through this transition. The hyperlink should continue to work – into and back out of these new app experiences. We also hope to see browsers on mobile and tablet devices continue to open up and evolve, allowing for more innovation around the web (rather than away from it). One fear that we have is that apps will evolve that behave as end terminals that absorb information and activity but don't feed back out. We hope the web's multiplying effect is preserved in these new places of interaction. 

It’s an incredibly exciting time for publishers, writers and readers. With these changes come some anxiety, but if harnessed properly new opportunities arise. We want to see the web continue to thrive whether by delivering the underlying data or the end-user experiences that are powering this important shift. 

As for Readability, we hope to do our part via our platform, tools and API to help make the web better – everywhere.
