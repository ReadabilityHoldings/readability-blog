                    Today we at Readability and our three judges—<a href="http://twitter.com/sarahchubb">Sarah Chubb</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/anildash">Anil Dash</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zeldman">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>—are proud to announce the winners of our <a href="http://www.readability.com/contest">API Contest</a>, where all comers put their skills on the line to vie for our <strong>$5,000 dollar grand prize</strong>.

We couldn't be happier with the quality of the submissions we received - thank you to every developer who submitted; even if you didn't win, your contributions to the Readability ecosystem are appreciated. Now let's get down to business!
<h2>SECOND RUNNER UP ($1,000 Prize): <a href="http://telepaper.newspaperclub.com/">The Telepaper</a></h2>
[caption id="attachment_1244" align="alignleft" width="250" caption="Reading has come full circle."]<a href="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/telepaper.png"><img class="recessed size-full wp-image-1244" title="telepaper" src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/telepaper.png" alt="A photo of The Telepaper, a newspaper of your Readability reading list." width="250" /></a>[/caption]

As far as creativity goes, <a href="http://telepaper.newspaperclub.com/">The Telepaper</a> wins out - they provide a service that allows you to make your digital reading list analog again, by printing runs of your reading list straight to newsprint and shipping them to you. The Telepaper is brought to you by <a href="http://www.newspaperclub.com/">Newspaper Club</a>, a self-serve newsprint company.

The service is prohibitively expensive for small runs (around $49 for a single newspaper shipped), but like traditional print runs, prices go down with scale. This could make it potentially useful for groups making limited runs of select articles. The source code to glue the two services together is <a href="https://github.com/newspaperclub/telepaper">open source, and available on GitHub</a>.

Congratulations to Newspaper Club for a fantastically inventive use of Readability.
<h2>FIRST RUNNER UP ($2,500 Prize): <a href="http://libris.me">Libris Me</a></h2>
[caption id="attachment_1249" align="alignleft" width="350" caption="Sync your reading list to any device with libris.me"]<a href="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/librisme.png"><img class="recessed size-full wp-image-1249" title="librisme" src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/librisme.png" alt="" width="350" /></a>[/caption]

Now for some pure, unadulterated <em>usefulness</em>: <a href="http://libris.me/">Libris Me</a> is a free windows application that allows you to sync articles to practically any reading device on the market. As Libris Me's entry into the Readability contest, they've added full Readability support, meaning that you can automatically synchronize your Reading List onto all supported reading devices. This brings offline reading to many users who might not yet have a Kindle or iPhone/Android device.

Congratulations to the Libris Me team!
<h2>WINNER ($5,000 Prize): <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.fahimk.readabilityclient&amp;feature=search_result">ReadIt</a></h2>
[caption id="attachment_1256" align="alignnone" width="240" caption="The Winner - ReadIt, an Android Client for Readability"]<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.fahimk.readabilityclient&amp;feature=search_result"><img class="recessed size-full wp-image-1256" title="readit" src="http://blog.readability.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/readit.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the home screen of ReadIt, and Android client for Readability" width="240" /></a>[/caption]

Sometimes, the most obvious approach is the best one.

Readability user Fahim Karim came at us with a full-featured, well implemented, open source Readability Android client - and needless to say, we were thoroughly impressed.

With <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.fahimk.readabilityclient&amp;feature=search_result">ReadIt</a>, you can browse your reading list, read articles, favorite and archive, and add a new article to your reading list. It includes full style settings and offline support. All in all, this is a full-function, third party Readability client for Android. And it's even <a href="https://www.assembla.com/code/readability-client/subversion/nodes">open source</a>.

A huge congratulations to Fahim, and thank you for providing such a useful asset to the Readability and Android communities.
