                    <span class="drop">O</span>ne thing I've noticed since Readability <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/01/the-new-readability/">launched</a>—it feels like I've unwittingly joined my first bookclub. The club is just a loose orbit of friends and family reading from the same lists of magazine articles each week, thanks to recommendations from longform curators (ex: <a href="http://longform.org/">1</a>, <a href="http://longreads.com/">2</a>, <a href="http://givemesomethingtoread.com/">3</a>). But we rarely share URLs directly via email or Twitter because it's understood that when we meet for drinks Friday night, we can incorporate something like <a href="https://www.readability.com/articles/k3m74fk8">the Paul Haggis Scientology piece</a> into conversation without needing to preface or cite it.

Love for certain content has linked us telepathically for years. Before the web, in my old town of Charlottesville VA it was unnecessary to ask, "did you hear that piece on NPR…" Everyone had heard the piece. Traces of NPR stories were in every conversation. Online, communities like Reddit and Boing Boing are able to keep large numbers of like-minded people ambiently aware of certain content, but their strength is mainly tracking memes.

The virtual club for magazine writing—the one I've been waiting for—finally feels like it's arrived. Why now? Compared to other web content, longform journalism has been tougher to organize and digest...

…and gets overloaded when there aren't ways to keep it centralized and easily referenced. Readability has helped solve a lot of these organizational problems. 

<blockquote class="pullquote">The beauty is in the marriage between Readability's mechanical algorithms and the human touch of web curators. </blockquote>But the app alone isn't the whole experience—the beauty is in the marriage between Readability's mechanical  algorithms and the human touch of web curators. Without them, the bookclub effect might disappear.

Curators provide serious legwork. They carefully handpick the good stuff to save you from sifting through overstuffed RSS feeds. They dig deep into the long tail of journalism to find <a href="http://www.maureenorth.com/1977/06/on-the-set-of-apocolypse-now/">gems like this one</a> which you might've missed.

Curators also provide perspective and sensibility. With so much ad-driven content-farm junk on the web, they remind you that good writing is still fundamental above all. They break you out of habitually relying on singular sources of content (see NPR above) which can give you tunnel vision. They keep the bar set high.

This summer Readability will continue to add more social features to our app that make it easier to share great articles across groups of friends. We would love to help make good journalism more of a bonding experience.
