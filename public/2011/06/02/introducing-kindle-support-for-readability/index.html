                    We're really excited to announce the latest update to Readability, featuring support for the Amazon Kindle:

<div style="text-align: center"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/24567685?byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="450" height="253" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

With this update, readers can now send any web article to their Kindle for reading at their convenience. To send to your Kindle, simply run the <a href="https://www.readability.com/addons">free Readability browser add-on</a> and click the <em>Send to Kindle</em> button. Moments later it will be available on your Kindle in a nice, comfortable reading format.

Subscribers of Readability can receive their entire reading list automatically in a convenient digest form. There’s no need to even “sync” to your Kindle. Every morning (or any other time you specify), we'll automatically push your reading list to your device.

For writers and publishers, we’re introducing a first for the web: <strong>a free, easily-embeddable "Send to Kindle" button</strong>:

Visit the <a href="https://www.readability.com/publishers/tools">Free Publisher Tools page</a> to find the code and instructions for installation. Soon, we'll be announcing some exciting partnerships around our Kindle support. 

There are host of other fixes, tweaks and updates with this update to Readability. We'll be sharing those details in future blog post. Beyond this release, we've got even more exciting things to come from the Readability team. Until then, happy Kindle reading!
