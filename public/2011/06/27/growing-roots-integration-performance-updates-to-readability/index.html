                    Every once in a while we like to step back and make some improvements that might not be the prettiest, but are nonetheless necessary for a stable and healthy application. We like to call them growing roots releases - things that will help us to branch out further in the future.

Today, we released a number of those improvements meant to help our users integrate and interact with Readability. The visible ones are:

<h2>Print, Email and a Customizer for our Embed Buttons</h2>
Our embeddable buttons have seen some great adoption since launch, and we've now made them a bit more featureful and customizable. The embed now includes two new optional buttons - "Print" and "Email". Both will allow you to have a clean, readable view of the content. 

[caption id="attachment_1031" align="alignnone" width="439" caption="Fig 1: Button Embed Configurator"]<a href="http://www.readability.com/publishers/tools"><img src="/wp-content/themes/rdb/images/configurator.png" alt="" title="slj-web"  class="size-full wp-image-1031" /></a>[/caption]


Additionally, we wanted to make it a bit simpler for our publishers to configure our embeddable buttons the way they'd like to see them on their website. You can now change background color, text color, and orientation as well as which buttons you'd like to see in your embed. <a href="http://www.readability.com/publishers/tools">See the new customization tool here on the free publisher tools page</a>.

<h2>Faster Reading with support for both HTTP and HTTPS</h2>
Before today, all of Readability has been under HTTPS, no matter who you were or how you were using Readability. While great for security's sake, this ends up having a significant performance tax, particularly at the beginning of a person's browsing experience - and given the way Readability works (many one-off hits throughout the day, sporadically), this was often annoying for our users, especially those who may be overseas.

So today we're opening up HTTP for all anonymous users and newly registered users. HTTPS will be the default for any existing users who have signed up to Readability so that they see a consistent security experience. All users have the option to disable "secure browsing" mode within their account preferences if they're less concerned about security and more concerned about performance. Of course, all pages with clearly sensitive data associated with them (account pages, APIs) will still be served under HTTPS regardless.


<h2>Support for xAuth within our REST API</h2>
As we've <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/06/reeder-for-mac-debuts-featuring-full-readability-integration/">written</a> <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/05/readability-in-the-wild-chrome-store-echofon-and-tweetbot/">about</a> <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/03/a-match-made-in-ipad-heaven/">before</a>, there are a good number of people doing cool things with our API; not to mention the contest submissions we've received - details on that soon! But we've also heard a number of developers complaining about the difficulty getting running with OAuth and the degraded experience associated with pulling up a web view in a native application. 

So today we're offering xAuth support within our APIs. <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/xauth">xAuth is a simpler protocol built on top of OAuth and popularized by Twitter</a>. Support for xAuth is open to everyone who uses our APIs - hopefully interacting with the Readability API should now be simpler and more straightforward. More information on our API is available on <a href="http://www.readability.com/publishers/api">our API docs page</a>.

In tandem with xAuth support, we've also open sourced a python-based API Library for Readability. The <a href="https://github.com/arc90/python-readability-api">source is available on GitHub</a>, and the package can be installed <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/readability-api/">through PyPi</a>. Contributions welcome!
