                    With the re-launch of Readability as a full-fledged reading platform, we made a commitment to deliver the best possible reading experience not only in your web browser but on mobile and tablet devices as well.

Today, we're excited to announce the release of the new, enhanced version of Readability for mobile and tablet devices. With this release, we're delivering a rich and comfortable reading experience on most popular tablets and smart phones.

We've always known that tablets and smart phones are a great way to consume content formatted with Readability. Now we've made it easier and more enjoyable than ever to do so. To install, simply visit <a href="http://www.readability.com">readability.com</a> and add the app to your home screen.

Readability for mobile features:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Drop a link and read comfortably...instantly.</strong> Anyone can visit <a href="https://www.readability.com">readability.com</a> on a smart phone or tablet and paste URL and within seconds, you're presented with a clean comfortable reading view.</li>
	<li><strong>Responsive display of the reading experience </strong>. Whether you're on an iPhone, Android, Barnes & Noble Nook or an iPad, Readability senses the dimensions of the device you're on and morphs the display accordingly.</li>
	<li><strong>Full offline support</strong>. All your articles are synced down to your phone for reading without Internet access. When you're off the grid, keep using Readability as usual and all of your actions - starring, archiving - sync up automatically once you're back online.</li>
	<li><strong>Customize and share</strong>. Tweak your display settings for each mobile device or tablet you use. Share any article you're reading via Twitter, Facebook or email.</li>
</ul>
Underneath the hood is...the web. Readability for mobile is a web application specially fitted for mobile and tablet devices. It's a great example of what can be achieved by building apps on the latest web technology.

A final thought regarding <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/02/an-open-letter-to-apple/">our iOS submission</a>: our overarching goal is to deliver the best possible experience to users of Readability. We re-submitted the Readability app to Apple along with an appeal approximately two weeks ago. We haven't heard back yet.

We hope you enjoy this update to Readability. It's 100% web technology and 100% approval-free and we're really proud of it. This release highlights the kind of firepower behind Readability. The team put this together in <em>two weeks</em>. It's a testament to building applications based upon web standardsâ€”effective, cross-device web applications can be built in a fraction of the time of a native app, and be provided without restriction.

Looking ahead, we plan to keep enhancing and building on the foundation we've established here. Happy mobile reading!
