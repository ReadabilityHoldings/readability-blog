                    Readability is, among other things, an advocate of the web standards movement. We made the decision to adopt the hNews standard, <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews">a microformat</a> pioneered by the Associated Press, for two reasons. 

<a href="https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines/"><img src="/wp-content/themes/rdb/images/hnews.png" class="aligncenter" alt="" /></a>

We believe better metadata is a laudable objective for making digital publishers' content work harder for themselves. But we also maintain that standards like hNews are the gateway to significantly advancing the user experience across the hardware and software we use—most especially for those seeking to innovate how readers can more efficiently and enjoyably consume content. 

So, in translation: <strong>do it for yourself; do it for others</strong>.

As our own contribution, we have developed <a href="https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines/">article publishing guidelines</a> for all who care to take up the web standards banner with us. Metadata matters, but we all have a stake in cleaner, more presentable content across the web.

The future of reading will not be televised—it will be parsed. But it's  on all of us as developers and publishers to make good on the potential of the metadata  at our disposal.

Check back with us in coming weeks as we take a closer look at the semantic side of Readability and the prospects of better reading for all.
