                    Today, we're excited to announce two big releases; the fastest, most feature-rich version of the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi">Readability extension for Google Chrome</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id460156587">Readability 1.2.5 for iOS</a>

<h3>The New Chrome Extension</h3>
With this version, our highest priority was to make drastic improvements to the existing features. Read Now, Read Later, and Send to Kindle have all been reworked to be faster, more responsive, and more dependable. Our second priority was to introduce a select number of new features to make reading with Readability even easier.

<h5>Tagging</h5>
We've made it easier than ever to keep your Reading List organized. Each time you bookmark an article for Reading Later you will have the option to add tags.

<h5>Context Menu Items</h5>
Want to quickly bookmark a handful of articles for Reading Later? Now you can just right-click on any link and select Read Later. You can also Send a page or a link to your Kindle, Read Now in a New Tab or Window, or quickly jump to your Reading List from the context menu.

<h5>Authentication</h5>
You can now log into your Readability account directly from the extension. No more being taken to a new page to log in if you Read Later on an article and are not logged in; the extension will bring the login form to you. Even better, the extension will remember what you were doing and complete that action once you've logged in.

<h5>Improved Speed</h5>
This thing is fast. Really fast. We've built a robust, dedicated server-side component whose #1 priority is to handle requests from the extension and to do so without you noticing.

<h5>Messaging</h5>
When you click a button or press a key, you expect something to happen. We've re-imagined how the extension communicates with you to make it crystal clear what's happening each step of the way. In the event that something goes wrong, the extension will make you aware of the issue and give you options for what you can do.

<h5>Customization</h5>
In previous versions of the extension you've had the option to set custom keyboard shortcuts. We've kept that in place and we now offer a couple of other customizations. You can now choose between two different icons styles; red or grey and if you don't plan on adding tags, you can turn off the tag prompt after a Read Later. We've also made the options easier to find; just click the gear icon at the bottom of the extension.
