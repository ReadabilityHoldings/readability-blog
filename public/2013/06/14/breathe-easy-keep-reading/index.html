                    It happens to the best of us. We add to our Reading List day after day. The number of saved articles grows into the hundreds; maybe thousands. We wait for that quiet Sunday morning where we'll finally get a chance to read all of that exceptional content. Often, that Sunday doesn't come. Our Reading List continues to grow and along with it the weight of guilt of the unread. We want to help lighten the load.
<h4>Introducing: Guilt Purge</h4>

Guilt Purge allows you to archive or delete all bookmarks in your Reading List that are older than an amount of time that you select. Age options are; 5 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months.
