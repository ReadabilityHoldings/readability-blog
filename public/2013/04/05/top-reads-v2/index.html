                    Thousands of times every minute, somebody uses Readability to have a better reading experience. Nearly five million people do it every month. We expect that activity to ramp up even further thanks to the hundreds of apps connected to our network.

Every single major publisher on earth has readers who find that content more engaging when delivered through our platform. And we're the first service in history to be able to deliver that content consistently across a vast array of apps on nearly every device in use today. 

From the outset, we wanted to put energy towards finding patterns and trends in all that activity that would be truly valuable to everyone. We didn't want just another "trending" list. We knew that the reading view represented a greater commitment to shut the world out and focus on reading something—an incredible valuable behavior to pay attention to. 

Today, we're introducing a new, more sophisticated version of <a href="http://www.topreads.com">Top Reads</a>. We've completely redesigned the experience and made the intelligence behind it even more compelling. It's an incredibly powerful way to discover great content that's worth your time. Just visit <a href="http://topreads.com">topreads.com</a> to get a birds-eye view of what people are reading on the web.

If you're not a fan of constantly visiting the same web page, just follow <a href="http://twitter.com/topreads">@topreads</a> on Twitter. It'll tweet out articles as soon as they heat up on the Readability service. iOS users can access Top Reads at any time right inside the Readability iOS app.

In the near future, we've got big plans to mine even more gold from all the amazing activity happening on Readability every minute of every day. We're the only reading platform and network that has that insight— and we look forward to sharing more of it.

Happy reading!
